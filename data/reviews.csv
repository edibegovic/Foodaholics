So fresh and full of flavor. The staff is very helpful. I needed to use the WiFi and they hunted down the password since it wasn‚Äôt common for guests to ask for it. I had to work while eating and they left me alone and allowed me to wrap up my call and eat at my own pace. I highly recommend checking out this gem and enjoying the reprieve from the busy city.

31,ChIJw0jc8TRRUkYRrv6MklmF90k,Antonela Topalo,en,5,1594210311,I have ordered a couple of times from Kai Sushi and was very impressed about sushi quality and thai food taste. Thai food became my favourite since I discovered Kai Sushi. :)
32,ChIJw0jc8TRRUkYRrv6MklmF90k,Christoffer Carleson,en,1,1593711607,"This was our second time going to Kai Sushi and we have in generel been very surprised about how good the food has been esp. for being a restaurant in Br√∏ndby √òster.

However, today we left the place not feeling like going back again unfortunately. We felt the service was really bad. After we had ordered our food we were asked if we wanted something to drink and we specifically asked for tapwater ‚Äúpostevand‚Äù. As we were about to leave the waiter insisted that we had not payed for water, which we assumed was for free as it comes from the tap. We did not want to make a scene and paid 2x20kr (40kr) for tapwater which we didn‚Äôt even drink at the end.

A pity that the service and the feeling you let us go with today will not have us come back nor recommend your place for others."
33,ChIJw0jc8TRRUkYRrv6MklmF90k,Zohal Zazei,en,5,1602350324,I think smaller sushi pieces would be better. The sushi was really big and with a lot of rice.

35,ChIJ55nnSTRRUkYRmhqoshskaq4,Karina Kannegaard,en-US,1,1631433666,"Ordered pepperoni pizza plus meat sauce for the youngest and they delivered the driest pizza I have had in a long time. There was almost no meat sauce or cheese on.
I would stay away from this place.
If you are so stingy that there are only a few teaspoons of meat sauce in small blobs, despite the customer paying extra"
36,ChIJ55nnSTRRUkYRmhqoshskaq4,Daniel Christensen,en-US,1,1621610783,"They do not look at their order form about what it is you order, we always order without tomato and onion and we get it anyway 9/10 times ..
Plus they always write that the food is ready much later than it actually is. If you are not aware of this, then you get cold food.

Otherwise fine pizzaria, but we will not order from there again."

First about the food: The times I've been in there I've only had pizzas with chicken. This is not a standard pizza bread. The bread is unique and tasty. It tastes freshly baked and lays a good base. It is always GOOD WITH FILL I. The salad that comes in is a very unique blend and is fresh and crispy and full of flavor. It is seriously the best pizza bread I've ever had and I like to go from the other end of Copenhagen for it.
Now to the staff. Always sweet and welcoming. However, it was my first visit that really intrigued me. I was on my way home from depression therapy, had a really bad day and was completely out of it. When I gave my order, the chef stopped and asked until me and did everything he could to cheer me up. He gave me vital advice on the way to fight my depression. For the first time in a long time, I had the feeling that no one cared and to this day I regret never being able to say thank you very much for doing so all my day.
A trip to the kebab is not something you would think could make such a big impression, but it really did. Thank you."

The vegan then got a salad with cress, tomato and pineapple !! The main course was the garnish from the roast we others got, potatoes and a single piece of meat were just smoked with. Espehus was once a rock-solid good place to eat, now you will find far more modern food and quality in a supermarket cafeteria. Arrogant chef who did not think he would serve mushrooms for her, because they were dusted up by pigs !!!
Sweet waiter who did his job despite poor conditions from the kitchen. Too bad for my parents who had been hoping for a nice evening at a real restaurant with kids and grandkids. And my last night, by many over the years, at Espehus."

In addition, bad chairs, it was old school wooden chairs. Unfortunately, the room has poor acoustics, which makes conversation difficult. At every new dish there were mistakes and the same with drinks. Thinking the waiters also have a hard time hearing what the guests are saying.
There was a large company that drowned out everything and everyone, and probably also removed focus from the other guests.

The bacon in the burger was not ready made.
I called down there and they told me they never wrapped the burger in paper as it ruins the burger and they had never done that.
The driver was the first to be blamed for the burger being destroyed from the pizzeria.
However, the food was hot enough so I do not blame the driver myself.
I will never have food from there again even though he would write my name down and then I could get a free burger the next time I came by."

If you order food, you always get the salad bar beside your food included in the food price, so no extra charge for salad bar as much as you like.

We ordered through the display and took the table number. Something was going on, most of the customers were waiting for it to be handed out. Many tables were messy and dirty. We found a table and cleaned it. After waiting 20 minutes, we picked up our cups so that we could at least have a drink, after 30 minutes the burgers and side dishes came. It was disappointing that the burgers were cold, the side dishes were hot. But we were so hungry that we didn't complain about the burgers. While we ate, was it less busy and one employee cleaned a few tables, the other employees recovered from the previous rush at the drinks machine. Don't get me wrong, everyone deserves a break, but everyone could have tackled the restaurant briefly and cleaned up the restaurant, e.g. sweeping the floor, putting the stacks of baskets from the rubbish bin in the kitchen, etc. Unfortunately, I did not understand the concept of the restaurant, structure like a Mc Donalds, prices like a restaurant, hip equipment, condition dingy and length of waiting times with then cold burgers.

So I had to cancel the order. I thought it was because of Friday night so I ordered a second time the next week, this time on a Wednesday. I ordered at 16:30 setting up the delivery time to 17:30. The food arrived at 17:50, with a missing burger and missing drinks in the kids meal. Apparently it wasn't the friday night, it was lousy work. Third time I knew what to expect so I ordered 2 hours before the time I would like to receive and it arrived in 1 hour 40 minutes. At least this time there was no missing items."

695,ChIJ8RdUL_NRUkYRIlGbbmzvjP4,Rune Fick Hansen,en-US,1,1632166587,"It was probably a strange and extremely bad experience.

We ordered take away from Tasty Take Away via Hungry.dk, which was easy and clear.

2 minutes after we had sent the order off, we were informed via text message that the food would not arrive until 1 hour due to busyness.

It's completely fair, but when we were four hungry people, we called Tasty Take Away to cancel the order (which said that you should do on Hungry.dk).

When we called, we were told that a mistake had been made and that they could guarantee that the food would arrive no later than ¬Ω hour. They had just pressed wrong when they accepted the order. Again fair enough. Mistakes happen. So we kept the order, and sat down to wait.

After two hours the food came ... We had tried to call several times along the way to hear if something had gone wrong, but now no one picked up the phone.

When we opened the bag, a Butter Chicken, a Naan bread, a rice and our drinks were missing ...

Not a super experience and the deliverer told that he just delivered and knew nothing about the order itself.

OK. Accidents happen. However, we called Tasty Take Away to say we would like the money back for the food and drink that had not been delivered.

This time we got hold of the chef, who a little aggressively told us that he was closing the kitchen, and therefore did not have time to talk on the phone.

He then told us that we had to physically show up at the store the next day, where he would then make a new dish for us, which we could then eat there.

We were not interested in that (we did not even know at the time where they were), but we just wanted the money back.

The chef then said that in that case we had to talk to the chef, which we then asked for. He then told us that the boss had been taken home and should not be disturbed tonight, but that we had to physically show up the next day if we wanted the money back.

I then asked if he would not ask the boss to call me the next day so we could get the money back as I had not intended to physically show up at the store.

Before I could finish saying this, the chef slammed the phone down, after which no one picked up the phone.

To put it mildly shocked, we then called Hungry.dk and told about our experience. They immediately gave us the money back and said they would take a chat with Tasty Take Away (good service and friendly staff. Thank you for that Hungry.dk).

When we subsequently sat down to eat the food that had been delivered to us after all, the various sauces were very bland. They simply lacked spices and tasted mostly just of cream.

The naan bread was by no means fresh. In fact, we could hold it in the edge, and then it was completely stiff and did not bend in the slightest.

So we must unfortunately say that neither the food nor (especially) the service can get more than bottom grade. Maybe we just hit the worst day of the year, but the experience has at least been so bad that we have chosen to share it."

We came in an empty and weirdly silent restaurant, they gave us a card than ignored us, no explanation on the ‚Äòall you can eat‚Äô formula or anything else. We came in late (we‚Äôre not form danemark so for us it was a regular time to eat) but still had to ask for the attention of a waiter, when we finally got it they kind of let us know we had to order everything at once. We got excited and ordered a lot since we were celebrating and had little time left before the kitchen closed. They told us we had to pay extra for what we didn‚Äôt finish and took to-go witch we were of course ready to do (and did do) but directly the staff obviously made fun of us behind our backs for ordering to much. They brought the food but that‚Äôs it, never asked if we needed anything or if things went well. When they were ready to close (we were not nearly finished to eat) they let us know not by telling us but by having someone playing very loudly with the restaurant keys. Then when we felt bad enough we decided to go, it took 10minutes for someone to notice us asking for the check. The first words of the guy bringing the check was to shame us for ordering to much. Very bad experience all together, i seriously do not recommend this place, we clearly felt we were annoying them by being there.
A note tough for the sweet waitress who tied to help us with the menu when we asked but Left soon after we arrived."

Too much ketchup and mustard, and too many pickles. No salad made it just legal too. Nausea. Not enough freshness. But it's probably just my personal sense of taste. We also asked about extra dark french fries. It is probably the only place that has actually been able to deliver in dark french fries. Extra crispy and golden brown. Good work.

Since everything is damn near perfect, I'll instead knitpick my very minor improvement wishes. 1) burgers are a bit to saucy and oily, meaning it's a bit of a mess eating them. 2) fries while great, needs to be salted and mixed pre-boxing, instead of salted after boxing. Bottom half of fries has little to no salt. 3) the menu is written like a lengthy loveletter to each burger, instead of a list of ingredients. For someone that's not a veteran customer, it's a 10 minute read trying to see what your options are."

This is among the best burgers in all of Copenhagen in terms of quality. You could perhaps find a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one or a burger that suits your needs better, but not for this price, speed or service.
The bread here is homemade, the sauces homemade, the patties are made on the spot. I have been here so many times and I‚Äôve happily introduced my friends and coworkers to this place.
The only negative thing I can say about it is that the menu does not have a vegetarian/vegan option, but you can just ask the staff for it and they will make it for you. Hell, even my friend who was doing keto asked for one without bread and instead got himself two patties with chili, cheese and onion between them.
The burgers are big so if you have a small stomach and still want fries, get yourself the kids menu for a slightly less than normal size burger and fries. And definitely go for the garlic mayo as it is way better than the other options.
It is theoretically possible to eat infront of the place but it is mostly takeaway only"

I have had few bitter restaurant experiences, but this one stands out.

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I‚Äôd ever had. It was so crowded that I couldn‚Äôt leave the table to get food because I was sitting in the corner and the seats from other tables just blocking my way out. Apparently, there were more customers than they could handle. We have been waiting for drinks for almost one hour. There were no waiters/waitresses to come to collect the dirty plates that just piled up. We were more than ten people and a few small kids. You can imagine how messy the table was. When we asked for a bill, they even lost the list of drinks we've ordered. They overcharged us because they miscalculated the fee for drinks. When we tried to point out the mistake, the most unprofessional thing happened which I  regret letting my kids witness. The manager started insulting us that you were so cheap and not welcomed to come here. What kind of service did you expect by paying 99kr/person. I am sorry that it had to end up with calling the police to defend our rights as customers. The restaurant still owes us an apology which we are still waiting for."

The fact that the ceiling was done without any sound isolation and having heavy wooden tables and chairs on the tile floor results in a loud scratching noise that can be easily heard inside of the apartments. And that happens on a daily basis.

When restaurant administrator was contacted she smiles and promises to help, but have never done so. The quick and easy solution is just to put soft bottoms on chairs legs, but that has not been done. We got a very ignorant response.

First I asked them to move their car off the walkway in order to take photos for Google Street View. I was trying to keep them from getting a parking ticket. Maybe they didnt understand English but the driver went out and moved the van and I did my job.

After I finished taking photos for Google Street View, I was passing the building and the owner comes out and berates me in Turkish and tells me to get the hell out of here. He pushes me while covering his face with a cloth from the kitchen. If I contacted the police, he would be given a fine of 10.000 Dkr and up to 3 years in prison for assault & battery seeing I am a registered Danish and European Presse Member. As it is now, I believe I will be talking with the Police and filling out a police report.

I know nothing of their food, but I would never visit a place where the ownership deals with people in this way. It was embarrassing and because I'm black, I'm sure he thought he could do what ever he wanted to me. What a terrible situation to put someone into when you physically attack them with no provocation. You lose their respect and their patronage.

I was told not to take a picture of the business or I would be sorry, so here is the picture I should not take."

The accompanying cola was also by no means properly cold. When you put it together, and add the unusually poor service, we land on a star. And it is given

Smiling staff & nice decor, as well as delicious Lemonade. but that stops the positive too,

It's the worst food I've ever tasted, & not only that the price is way too expensive for * a * net salmon they could at least give 2 when it's just a discolored fish from Netto they serve, as well as half raw portions of potatoes & something no matter iceberg lettuce that contains no vitamins.

474 for 2 people for some lousy food I would not even give to a homeless person, simply shameful.

On top of that, it abounds with ants on the tables & in the bar inside, really poor hygiene.

but again I am not disappointed had not expected otherwise, it is a bistro after all, however, had expected the price to be less for something so boring.

I will never eat there again, a shame to see that an old wonderful restaurant was turned into a l ....

Would discourage anyone I know from putting their legs there.

One time I ordered and I paid and the guy after 5 min asked me again to pay again (twice) for one order. I told him that I paid one time and he was I don‚Äôt remember that you paid. I was ok maybe it is a mistake maybe he really forgot.
But after few days it happened again. He asked again to pay twice.  And it was completely normal for him to say how can i forget  that you paid.
I told him ok I can pay again no problem just I will never come here again. His behaviour was really low quality. I understood  that for him was completely  normal to be like this.
I really got disappointed from his behaviour.

And I'll keep doing so whenever I'm ordering a sushi delivery. The sushi tastes great and the ingredients seem high-quality. It's quite inexpensive considering it's sushi. And while the delivery might be 5 to 15 minutes late from my selected time, I think that's OK - considering the low price, and the fact that the place isn't exactly close to my home, the taste of the sushi and the 20% discount make the delay worth it. I believe that several of the deliveries have actually been delivered by the owners themselves, which makes me appreciate the service even more, especially since they even put in the effort to climb up 7 floors as the elevator in my building is broken. This sushi place is a hidden gem, something you probably wouldn't expect from a sushi place located at a train station."

And one of the customer that came later than us, order later than us, get their food first while we only get cola. When the shrimp ris paper finally served, the customers came after us almost finished their food. At the same time we are starving.

I finally leave here 52 mins later AFTER we order the food. While the customers came later than us already finished their food.

We've got:
1. Chop suey with chicken, which comes in actually quite small portions, which you probably just have to be aware of. If you are hungry, it is probably not enough food. The taste is fine, but does not taste of chop suey - or maybe it tastes a bit of a pre-Danish version.

2. Bella Grill bacon / cheeseburger, which in addition to being cold, tasted quite good.

3. Samosas with meat that is the size of a normal spring roll and not ‚Äúsamosa size‚Äù. They tasted great, but you have to be happy with the cumin to make them popular. They have a hard aftertaste of cumin.

4. A tray of french fries, which in addition to being cold was also a little unfinished and very soft."

There was a general atmosphere that I seemed to notice of people not quite enjoying their food. Totally uninspiring.

Service was not terrible but it wasn't particularly good either.

I ordered sm√∏rrebrod and was shocked when literally what looked like something a child could make came out; no care or attention to detail given, simply 3 pieces of rye with tuna smacked on the middle of one with some sauce slapped onto it.
My husband's was worse. He got three pieces of rye with salami and a piece of cheese on each. We were both aghast. And the cost for this ? 227 DKK and we were not full or content in the slightest.

Despite having a very extensive website (but no phone number) for ordering, with check boxes for all thinkable combinations for your chosen dish, there is no checkbox for whether you want rice with your curry, and, just so it is clear, you don't.
So when you arrive home you're out of luck. If you're lucky, you can start cooking while your food gets cold, if you're not, you'll have to eat your curry as a soup.

Most are ok but often quickly forgotten about in the meaning of life. Once in a while, something rises up above the norm and stands out. This was the case with Sushi Master. It was some of the freshest sushi I have tasted.
Normally Nigiri  are often pieces left over in my family, as they tend to be very dry, boring and pre-made.
The ones I had last night were lovely and fresh and moist and in a few minutes my family had quickly devoured them, something I have never seen before.
The California and crispy Eli were also beautifully fresh and tasty.
When my two teenage boys tell me how much they liked it, I know I‚Äôve found somewhere special.

This particular branch is located not far away from Valby train station and just next-door the American fast-food Bone's. It is definitely a sophisticated place, but since you are in Denmark do not expect any out of this world dress code for neither the ladies nor the gents. The only setback I find the proximity to the other customers since the sitting (the main area) is one long table with chairs from both sides, which is easily fitting both 20 guests of the same company or a couple from another company. Kinda not cool to listen to the neighbours' conversation while you enjoy your sushi. I believe they do only take out right now due to the actual pandemic mode the country has switched to. The food is of high quality, maybe slightly overpriced, but again the quality is with the high price. They even have a small children menu which is adapted to the children' taste. Do make sure to mention NO SOY sauce if your child is allergic to it since even the children menu might include small amounts of soy sauce."

I'm as fan as anyone else of spicy flavors, but the spicy tuna nigiri was EXTREMELY hot, the only noticeable taste was hotness and my mouth was numb after trying it and I couldn't taste anything else afterwards. That was probably OK since the quality of the sushi was rather bad.

It is worn, boringly decorated, has a bearing on the disco atmosphere of the bowling alley below, and there is virtually no space for people - which is in harmony with what is written. And the food seems really very be without positive impression; It is actually completely without salt, or suffocated in salt, it is tasteless and made without soul and love for food. And you should not have bought nuggets and fish fillets in a restaurant buffet, it does not last!

It's a real shame, because there are some elements that signal that they would like to be a completely different place. The people are sweet, the jugs are big, there is a nice cut of roasted piglet and roast (where the taste is limping, as written) and they are welcoming.

I wish they were servicing and facilities a little better before opening, so it was sharp, and hired talented people in the kitchen with a sense of food, and one over to cook it. If that happens, I will come again."

The service is also immaculate, and the owners are kind, friendly and very helpful. The ingredients are always fresh and never dip in quality.

Service staff is friendly, but slow- we had to personally walk in and ask for menues and the bill at the cashier... The interior design is well balanced with vibrant Thai music running in the background, but the facilities lacked handsoap (in corona times!) and the sensors for the tap kindly provided for either no water at all or a friendly splash all over the patron's pants.
The food looks good on pictures and the menu is well organised, unfortunately that's as far as this place goes. Tom yum soup, veggie rolls with peanut sauce and beef curry were all probably some of the worst tasting Thai food I've had in my life. Not only were they not authentic, but overly salted, coriander used was probably 50% of the dish and the chilli reminded a kebab mix instead. All of this at a hefty overpriced tag roughly 40% above authentic eateries or 25% for similar modern restaurants.
We've been there twice in the past 3 months and can confirm the experience above isn't an isolated incident or unfortunate circumstances.

The dishes is Danish vegan food, focused on traditional Danish food like rye bread, stews, paste, ""rissoles"" based on lentils and such. They use organic, locally and seasonal ingredients.

Green Love is probably the first place in Denmark (at least in Copenhagen) to do a traditional Danish kitchen, in a vegan AND wholefood version. I am therefore very excited, because I've been waiting for that in several years :)

And now to the taste:
Irene (the owner) have a huge love for food, that you can taste in your very first bite. The ""rissoles"" have the perfect texture, the ryebread is fresh, and the salad too.
The day I arrive you can choose either rice-lentil ""rissoles"" or a paprika-stew. I choose the rice-lentil ""rissoles"", which you can see in my picture.
And the dishes will, as mentioned, change every second week.

So a warm recommendation from me."

I wanted to hear from you before I posted a review. Since I never got a response, I posted it so that people who know how a paratha and naan tastes like can make an informed decision.
This is my honest review and I will leave it at that. I never wanted any compensation, since it‚Äôs the food I ordered and consider it as spent.  But, I would like to know why the list of promises which attracted us to dine here did not seem to.

****************************

Been here with family for dinner. The food quality was below average. The parathas were not edible which seems like frozen ones that‚Äôs heated and the naans , this is nowhere close to what a naan is.
Unfortunately ordered lots of food at once and ended up wasting it.

Left the restaurant hungry , but had a pizza in another restaurant  to finish the dinner.

The food:
The main courses are mostly meat with rice and vegetables. The sort of meat that taste a bit burned because it's made on a grill (if that's your thing then it was good)
The rice was really nice.
The vegetables was a bit bland but nicely crispy

What makes this food a special Persian experience, is the side-dishes and the appetizers. Normally I'm not fond of yoghurt dishes, but I recommend the one with the little onions in (forgot the name). The mixed salat was nice with loads of different thing in it.
I also recommend the homemade vanilla ice cream with saffron and pistachios. It was very satisfying without being sugary. The figgs in honey, though, was less satisfying. You'd expect it to be round and sweet but it was a sort of weird bitter taste.

The people:
We waited a bit long for the food, but the people were absolutely lovely and and genuine.

The space:
If I lived close by, I might use it as a take-away, but I'll NEVER come back to eat in the restaurant again. The acoustic are absolutely unbearable. I had to step outside a couple of times. We had to shout at each other, at the table. And when we left my nerves and head felt horrible.
A shame, as they obviously put a lot of effort into making the interior genuine Persian (Iranian?), With little pictures on the walls and some impressive decorative metalwork.

We didn't hear noise from the kitchen and I didn't notice the condition of the toilet (which means that it was probably fine).

It's a small space. Not good for wheelchair users. The staff seem very willing to meet special requests."

The children's menu was the same, but the vegetables were old touching the rotten side, the noddles were far too overdone, and the fiskefrikadelle (which I though it was a good addition) tasted much worst than the one I got in my dish, like if the fish was not fresh, opposite to mine that tasted really good. On the positive side, when we complained about the vegetables they changed them for new fresh ones with a smile with no trouble at all, the waiter service was really nice all the time, and the whole restaurant is very clean and nice, and that¬¥s why I give 2 stars.

There was room for dessert in every way. My friend chose petit four. It was two small pieces of chocolate truffle - approx. the size of a woman's thumb nail for the net sum of 45 kr. I chose bread ice cream with rhubarb - they had forgotten to write that the whole bottom consisted of fresh cheese, but as the waiter boldly said ""you can not taste it at all"".

Good starter.
Semi-fine main course.
Boring dessert.
But worst of all we were forgotten and had to spend 3 hours getting through the 3 servings that probably actually made up their signature menu (and therefore should play completely) and we were only offered drinks twice before the coffee. Unfortunately, it came to dominate our experience, which can not get more than 2 stars.
I would not recommend Hanzo Frederiksberg based on this visit."

I don't know if the dramatic decline in quality is because the food was delivered to our doorstep - but then again, except for maybe a slightly different visual appearance (due to the handling) the quality should be almost the same. It was not!

The sushi we bought was almost without taste...except for the rice that had a heavy taste of rice vinegar. Much worse were the Udon noodles with beef. The beef was layered with fat and the noodles had a foul greasy taste. This was a really bad experience. I know that dine-in is normally good but it is really important with a consistent quality. Step up the delivery game guys!"

Arrived and the woman working there was smoking outside making the whole store smell inside. She came to take our order and I was a bit confused because I have never been there before and she could clearly see that. Not only this woman was NOT wearing a mask while preparing our food, she was also moody and really didn't feel like she wanted to be there. I asked her what I was able to get on the sandwich and she said : ""1 meat and everything else you want"". I made my sandwich the way I wanted it and then my friends ordered theirs. When we went to pay, instead of covering 39kr she covered me 65kr. I asked why and she said it was because of the cheddar cheese which was suppose to be +5kr?!?!? Which still doesn't add up for what I had to pay, plus I was not informed I had to pay more for the cheddar cheese! Once I tried to get an explanation from her  she was rude and said it was my fault I didn't ask for the prices (which I didn't have to cuz it was saying right on top, just not these extras) plus she said the promotion was only from Monday to Friday which is not written anywhere.

I payed and asked for her name and she refused to do that. I asked for my recipt and was also not given one.

Food is actually good and quantities are also good. But the experience was horrible and I will keep on complaining until I get a satisfying answer. The way this woman treated me as a costumer and the way she neglected the rules through a pandemic are insanely rude and I will take this matter further if nothing is done."

We were 6 people and we were not served all at the same time! 2 pizzas were arriving 10 minutes apart from each other!

No, they simply run away with my money and declined to refund. Even though I had already tipped their driver for the delivery at this point, they did not care.

We just moved in to Frederiksberg and we wanted to try it after the lockdown because they advertised in huge letters ""all you can eat, Monday to Thursday, 139dkk"". We ordered drinks and waited. After 20 minutes without being served, the waiter explains to us how the all you can eat works and he tells us that the price is 259dkk each. We ask about the advertising and he says that the reduced price is only for children up to 11, and that the advertising says ""from 139dkk"" so it's technically correct. Really, is that how you trick your clients? That trick is used in the cheap touristic places where you know clients won't come back...but in a neighbourhood in Copenhagen? Of course we left the place in a bad mood and without eating, so I can't judge the food. I'll never come back to this place and I discourage you from ever trying it.

I ordered from there a few times. Each time it is a bit of a lottery: sometimes you get what you asked for and one replacement only; another times you get a few ingredients substituted with no prior comments.

Today I ordered a very simple pizza: mushrooms, pepperoni, cherry tomatoes, red onion. Removed pepperoni when ordering online and asked for no cheese in a comment.

What I got: pizza with no pepperoni (thank you!), loaded with cheese, white onion instead of a red one and normal tomato slices instead of cherry tomatoes.

The Pizza is different, but it's just fresh flat bread with something on it. I ordered steak pizza, but actually it was just bread with some normal Pastrami you can find in all the supermarkets without any taste.
They just put a lot of brownies sauce on it which doesn't let you notice the other tasteless ingredients.

I didn't like it at all.

THE TOILETES WERE EXTREMELY DIRTY.

I asked for tissues several times and finally I had to go inside and pick it up myself.

Also, serving Cola in can is not nice. Specially when they sell a 3kr cola for 30kr. It should be served in glass bottles or big coke glass. Not in Can.

For lunch they had prepared my favorite dish which was otherwordly: could not have made it better myself! It was . The complimentary beer was a nice IPA. They offer a small variety of beer both known and unknown (the Buddha? (name forgotten) beer is highly recommendable).  Trying a variety of their sm√∏rrebr√∏d in which I had cheese complimented with apples (super combination!) was very good!

Their desserts were likewise delcious and my small nephew had their homemade tricolore ice cream - which I had a taste of - and must say consistency and taste was good. I had an applepie myself which likewise was good.

The service on the other hand was under all criticism. There were two female waiters, one was angry from the start for no reason, maybe just her attitude and when we asked about the menu, she almost did not want to look us in the eye and did not smile at all. The other waiter who then served us with order and when we had to have the bill, also had attitude on. When our child touched the receipt when she put it on the table, she got really annoyed about it and said to the child: ""I just have to see what it says"". One does not need to speak with such a tone to a small child at all when we are there as paying customers.
There was no further service than ordering and paying.
It's a shame that you get the feeling that you are not welcome or that you are in trouble. It must be said that we neither complained about anything, asked for anything besides food and bill, and we just sat and took care of ourselves."

I had an old discount card with me, 4 of 5 stamps checked, supposedly giving me 50% off my order. When I ordered I made sure to show the employee the card and he agreed that I would receive a discount of 50% off the main order of 36 mixed pieces, not the sides. After waiting 15 minutes, another employee showed up, he apparently spoke to the person who took my order, and told him my discpunt card was invalid. The card had no expiry date, and had the same address and website URL as the current place. I argued that they were obligated to give me the discount, as there was no expiry date and it's the same place, and the money for the four stamps had been spent there. He insisted I would not receive the 50% discount, and that I would have to talk to the former owner about it. I argued that the employee who took my order had confirmed that i would receive my discount. At this point I was getting impatient, and they were ignoring my complaints that it was their responsibility to honor not only the discount card issued, but also the guarantee of the employee who took my order. The cashier said she was sorry several times, while the unapologetic ""chefs"" ignored me rudely.
Astonishing to have them tell me that I should contact the former owner and discuss it with him, when clearly they have the responsibility to cash in any discounts issued there, and make good on the promises of the person who took my order.
I left disappointed, surprised, and slightly but righteously angry. I will never take my business there again, and will recommend to anyone they go to a different place than that when feeling the sushi cravings."

Be sure to get a reservation - we stumbled in without one, unfamiliar with the neighborhood or the restaurant and were just lucky they had a cancellation - little did we know how lucky we were!  This place deserves a Michelin recommendation.  The staff were warm and welcoming, translating the menu for us as best they could and the chef brought out the mains to explain the idea he was after with the dish.

The burgers are good and comparable to many of the equally priced ones in Copenhagen, though there are other places I might go before Burger Shack for a great bruger.

The food transports okay but gets boring if you don't live within 10 minutes travel time from the restaurant, as that's the max time before it starts to get boring in the take away bag.

I came in with 2 others from my team.
They were both served before me. It is commented that there is a lot of content in their bagles and the owner boasts that he never saves on anything!
When it's my turn, the cream cheese is scraped so thin that it is not noticeable, and the filling is very sparsely put in. I have to ask for dressing and the things I would have liked to have in of onions and salad. A little reluctantly with a wry grimace, I get a bit of onion and salad.
When we get up in class we compare our bagels and mine is only half as tall as my two friends' on the same order.
I'm pretty much bigger than them and I'm sure it's due to my weight that the owner would not fill anything in the bun.

The open kitchen and the colorful decor offer a good atmosphere during the dinner and clearly set up a cocktail or 3 as a conclusion to a good experience. At least we'll be back!

The roast beef at times went slightly above comfortable acidity level on the remoulade and pickles, as well as the meat itself might have been more moist. While the egg and shrimp dish could have just had a bit more lemon mayo.

Location: Perfectly located in the middle of Copenhagen. Easily accessible by bus, metro and bike. You'd have troubles finding a parking spot for your car though.

Environment / Atmosphere: Cosy and family-friendly. You can come with your family, friends or partners.

Service:

Positive - The staff was great at answering despite the business. They were pretty kind and thoughtful towards the customers. The kitchen workers were pretty fast at making the entire order, which took around 20mins to be ready (it is way normal for a busy time like that).

Negative - They give an IPad and a sheet of paper to fill in for the Ad Libitum orders, but we weren't informed previously that either we should make the order on the IPad or the sheet. It turned out that we can see the pictures of every sushi type on the IPad, which was even more complex to look through.
It was pretty convincing in the beginning because in some other sushi places the IPads work as the order sheets.

Place: The restaurant is not small but not big either. This type of medium sized restaurants has to keep the reserved seats available because we had made a reservation at 19:00, we arrived on time but we had to wait for 20 minutes for our seats to be available. It is understandable that they are busy at those times, but if we've made a reservation, then we should get the tables right away.

Other than that the toilet wasn't really taken care of.. There were toilet papers missing, and it was a bit dirty inside. (it happens during the busy times, totally normal)

Taste and Price: The taste of everything was super good - from the appetizers, hot meals to sushi and fish types. It is worth having the Ad Libitum for the offered price. üç•üê†"

Also, no care of the table setting too, it didn't seem too clean and no table cloth was provided.

Wine chapter: no comment. They would serve supermarket wine (only mentioning the denomination e.g. ""Chianti DOC"", ""Sangiovese"", not to spoil what the bottle really is) at ridiculously high prices. In a separate wine list, they offer many aged wines, but only for VERY special occasions üí∏

Pricing by weight seems strange when it includes both greens and meat, making you go for meat and not heavy potatoes, mushrooms, or greens to justify the price. Sandwiches are also way too much bread compared to contents, for the prices they're sold at.
Worse, there's no strategy to stop food getting thrown out when it's not sold during the day. Letting students buy food at a cheaper price in the late afternoon instead, or in other ways prevent this food waste should be prioritized highly. I know this is possible with some products, but any information around this is very very scarce.

You pay for everything as well, 2kr for plastic cutlery, 1kr for cardboard boxes, and even a whopping 3kr for 20cl boiled water. I would like to see some kind of subscriptions or vouchers, etc.

The bed wasn't very good though and definitely needed chucking out. The toilet seat was wonky. The hinges on the bathroom door needed oiling. Really the place needed a bit of TLC.
Location was great though, with major roads and cycle lanes just outside and a train station only a few minutes walk away. We rented bikes from the hotel and that proved to be a really good deal and an excellent way for us to get about and see the city.

the flaws of the age and lack of renovation shows the moment youre no longer in the lobby and ground floor!

And i cant help the disapointment of the lack of pillows in my room, as of it was a mistake by housekeeping, since i only got 1 tiny pillow in this massive bed, and a very thin blanket...
And if the neighbour room makes too much noice, you will hear them!

The breakfast isnt the best, very limited buffet, but the food that is there is tasty! Bread and buns are freshly baked!

All in all, not my best hotel experience, and absolutely not what i would expect from a 4 star hotel!

One big problem I experienced was the fact that they don't have a direct phone no. All communication is via e-mail, and I experienced not getting a response until 1 hour before our reservation started. I invited my boyfriend on his birthday, and I surprised him by inviting 2 friends. I had asked several questions: if they offer vegan options, if they could provide a flag and cake for him. Unfortunately they don't do, so I asked if it was okay for us to bring a small (vegan) cake with candles and flag, I even had to leave my phone no. hoping they'd call. No response until one hour before us coming. I hadn't checked my mail nor seen the missed call, we were already on the way. When we arrived that's when I'm told they'd charge us if we were to eat the cake, which is fine. I assured them that we'd still order dessert. After we'd ordered dessert, which we were told could be made vegan, we had started to eat the cake we brought. Then we were told it couldn't be made vegan anyways, so they'd charge us for the cake we had brought and just eaten! They ended up not charging us, but all this confusion could have been avoided if they just had a phone no. for costumer's to be able to ask basic questions.

The curry was bland and didn't taste of much, and it was really fatty. I get that Indian cuisine can be quite heavy, but this was not delicious.

On top of that, it was the worst service I have received in many years, even though there was 4-5 people working.

When ordered from other indian restaurants like Bollyfood or Kebabish the quantity which I receive for one person is the quantity which we received from you for 2 people.

Wolt tried to help, but the restaurant staff said they need permission to do anything and the only think they do is to send it further the complain.

However for those interested in the rest of the experience, let me start with excellent service.
Our waiter has explained in depth for us the characteristics of each cut of beef which was really helpful since it was our first time with Kobe.

For starters I went with the fried softshell crab. Perfectly crispy on the outside and the meat inside was still so tender... A little spicy which was just right for me but keep that in mind if you do not do spicy.

Afterwards came the star of the show - our around the world set that included a Kobe beef steak, dry-aged Danish ribeye and a ""standard"" New York strip. All medium-rare to medium.
Even if you prefer medium steaks like me, I would really recommend going for medium-rare Kobe, trust me I feel that made this piece just perfect.
Dry-aged ribeye was easily the best steak I have eaten excluding the Kobe, but let's be honest - you just cannot get close to that one.
New York strip was a really delicious steak that had the most familiar flavour to me as I am used to more standard steaks like that.

All that accompanied by fine Argentinian wine made for one of the most enjoyable evenings.

It is really an experience rather than simple dinner. Wholeheartedly recommend you visit!"

Before doing this fix trick, they had an average rating of around 4.0 (based on hundreds of reviews). Which is not very high - it is e.g. in line with the usual Chinese buffet.

I was actually just in to check if they had the answer to my review that I wrote a month ago. Seems really self, it was constructive and matter-of-fact. Have before been very fond of Fabio and been there many times, but think they have fallen off on it and e.g. do not bother with tasting and temperatures. Had given them 3 stars. But now there is just one more star smoking due to this little smart feint with the change on google.

But yes, it's probably easier to change his restaurant name on google than to roll up his sleeves, look inwards and make more effort in his restaurant. You can easily make good Italian food with cheap ingredients, so no, I do not think Covid is an excuse. If Fabio makes an effort, they will probably have to get through the crisis. If not, well then they probably smoke along with all the other restaurants that are not skilled enough to have loyal customers. Yes, at least I'm not a loyal customer anymore."

But tiramisu‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Why did you have to do that to my taste buds, whyyyy? I can never understand how you can go wrong with this simple dessert. The only taste that I could feel was if the liquor in which savoiardi were just drenched to the point that there was no taste or texture left. The cream was liquid and without pronounced taste of mascarpone, I am not sure how much mascarpone was there. I could not finish‚Ä¶. And this is my fav dessert which takes literally 30 mins to prepare and needs 5 simple ingredients. I don‚Äôt know why it went so wrong‚Ä¶..

The head chef dropped by too, to discuss some of the finer choices in ingredients, and we could not have asked for me. If I had to find something, it was that the chefs with their covid-masks had a hard time making themselves heard to the entire party of six, but a menu was laid out for each guest (so it's not really a criticism, but it was they only thing I could think of).

Afterwards I had yaki udon with carrot, shiitake mushroom, zucchini & miso sauce. The miso sauce was on the sweet side and had the concentrated intensity of a condiment. It was tasty but way too intense for the small amount of udon noodles that were literally swimming in sauce. The simple remedy is to either serve less sauce, more noodles or add a bit of water to the sauce to tone it down.

The service was very friendly."

For people with no taste buds or people who simply don't enjoy a great taste experience, this would be the go-to place. Despite never being to Taiwan, I can simply not believe thay it differs so greatly from Chinese food. Furthermore, simply by following authentic Taiwanese recipes, I got a completely different taste experience compared to the awful food that I got from nihao YAO, which further supports the idea that their food is not authentic.

The take-away summed up:
Their food has definitely been westernised, which defeats the purpose of calling it a Taiwanese restaurant."

In the day time they serve up a great durum with fresh ingredients, a smile and good service.

I was tempted by the sign outside with chicken and thought‚Ä¶ when they sign with it, well then they must know something.
An extremely friendly waiter greeted us at the nicely decorated place.
I ordered the offer - which was not an offer when I gave DKK 99 minus 25 percent - and on top of that DKK 39 for a coke.
The fries were few and not salty enough for my taste - but good crispy. The chicken was not me what so ever. Too much breading and too much fat. Extremely bad experience.
The boyfriend got a juice with spinach, ginger, apples, etc. - it was good. The same was her Bowl with halloumi.
The place should opt for a smaller menu and cut the chicken off. There is a lack of a place on the street where you give it gas with delicious bowls.
Go narrow and deep - with a smaller menu.

Hov, even though we were the only ones on site they took 20 minutes for serving .."

You could do that easily by stating approx. weight in grams (~ 120 g.). Even though you recommend 2-3 portions, we started with 2 portions and left to buy a pizza, since we were still hungry. So one more portion would not have solved that, as recommended.

Excellent breakfast/brunch with lots of products which are homemade or organic. The smoothie with banana, coconut and cereal was delicious.
Very good cappuccino too!
Reliable wifi available, mind that often there's some time to wait because this place is very popular.
Denmark isn't a cheap place to begin with so since you'll spend a lot anywhere you go, better choose GOOD places and Mad & Kaffe surely is one."

Everything tasted good to great, including the drinks. Fast and kind service, we got our food 10 minutes after ordering despite full house. On a Wednesday noon.

The interiors and room, however, is not to my liking. You sit uncomfortably on wood, bad acoustics, and overall a cheap, messy look.

Looking forward to revisiting in summer to sit outside. Can definitely recommend the food."

Downside: They only accept Danish cards and cash. If you are a tourist, make sure to have cash on you. If you don't, you have to walk over to the atm and there is a fee for withdrawal of cash."

The staff gave us brilliant service, and when I made a joke to the waiter that I'd love a spoon to finish the delicious gravy of the main, she promptly returned with a bowl of bread for me to mop it up.

I was thrilled to see another bubble tea place open close to Frederiksberg but I will probably not go again.
The tea was not noticeable through the quite synthetic/candy-like fruit flavor. It tasted more like a melted popsicle, complete with being somewhat lukewarm though it was shaken with ice. Combined with the popping pearls and being way too sweet I couldn't drink more than 1/3 of it.

Usually I would judge a bubble tea place by their classic milk tea with tapioca, but they had neither a classic milk tea or tapioca pearls. They did have an option to add milk, which usually curdles the overly sweet and sour teas, like the passionfruit we were recommended to try. We did not add milk.

The service was fine but one of our teas weren't properly sealed, so it spilled a bit when driving home and we couldn't drink it normally by punching the straw through.

Again, not for me but I am sure it'll be popular with kids for the sweet, candy-like drinks."

There was nothing that was directly hazardous to health or moldy, but the ingredients, the side dish and the taste made the food very unappetizing and we simply had to throw it out.

But definitely when it comes to Durum Wraps I've had better. The wrap tasted a little ""doughy"", like it needed just a little more cooking. For my taste there wasn't really a great deal of chilli or flavour to the contents. I liked my falafel a little less firm than those in this wrap. But overall the wrap was okay. I did eat it all :)

I had the veggie quesadilla - it was frozen vegetables that were put in a tortilla and had cheese on top. The burrito was practically the same only that additionally it had beans. Even the nacho chips were stale. The only good thing was the guacamole. I haven‚Äôt been to Mexico yet, but I would hope this is not authentically Mexican as some comments read.

Discussing in front of us what they had to do with us, and then hurrying us to our (still reserved) table. After we sat down, we were just being left there to sit. Until we decided to leave.
No sorry, no service. I understand they were busy, but this was pure arrogance towards their guests. We went elsewhere and had a lovely evening. But this place was an awful experience."

The design of the hotel is nice! It has a great vibe to it. Comes across as a boutique hotel, much different than the big chains!

The garden is also a good spot to be. Especially in the evening when they turn on the fireplace.

Inside there is a nice bubble bar, with an extensive selection of champagne and Prosecco.

Downsides: loud noises from people ‚Äòpartying‚Äô until late and when you‚Äôre located near the garden, you can smell sigarette smoke..

The breakfast is organic, which is nice. But the selection of things you can choose from is limited.

The staff is friendly and helpfull. And the rooms are ok, nothing really special."

The service was a bit strange, lots at the beginning, and then left very much on your own, even by scandi/danish standards. E.g. ordered very quickly, and then drinks, bread, starter came very quickly afterwards. Then a very long wait until plates were cleared. Not a huge deal, just a bit strange.
The place was quite crowded, and seating was very tight where I was seated - not much room to move or even get to the seat. And it was very hot in the restaurant - and overheard others complain about it as well. And note: water costs about 30dkk pr person - quite pricey!
Overall, food was really good, service was good albeit very sporadic, but the dining area was poor."

The food is really authentic. This is not a restaurant that is just churning out dishes to the masses, you get a true sense of pride in what they do. Even my second course was a true Neapolitian style tasting pizza rather than the mass produced style that you see in most restaurants.
One of our friends has a milk allergy and they were super flexible in offering different suggestions and the chef even offered to make her a special dish- something almost unheard of.
We even tried some of their home made limoncello which was to die for!
But it's not just the food that make it great, all the staff are all super friendly and knowledgeable.
We got served by several girls last night and I was amazed at how all of them were super service oriented and all so friendly. The manager that night was Emma and you could see what a great team spirit she created with all her staff.
The result of it all was a super great evening with really great food, great wine ( Try the Toscana) and bloody great service!

Have to give only three stars because the calamari at the bottom of the cup were drenched in oil... A big no-no. Also, as you can see by the pic, the fish was literally covered in salt... I mean, it was tough to even eat it bit by bit...

Not a fan of the taleggio cheese. I love cheese but in my opinion it had a slight off taste and didn't complement the cheddar at all. Onions and pickes were a bit absent as well. Fries were super crispy though.

Besides that the beef was great and it was probably the best brioche bun I've ever had, they did a great job sourcing those.

Wait, what?
Yes, I'm strange that way that I don't have the cravings to eat pizza, but once in awhile, especially in inebriated state, I could definitely devour a pizza and that occasion happened after the wonderful CBC on Saturday.

What else could you do when you're drunk at 14.00 in K√∏dbyen? That's probably no brainer, but somehow we ended up here because mother doesn't want to sell pizza yet at that time (they insist to sell brunch until 15.00) and that this place was on our way to kihosk.

Pizza-wise. Yummy for 39 kr lunch special. I got mine with bacon and onion, that said - how else could it go wrong that way? You can't mess up pizza that contains bacon, onion and cheese. Three stars, because it's so easy to be good. I'd probably have to try other menu to make sure that this place does good pizza as claimed.

PS: I just found out that this is a chain of pizzeria and most of the places are consistently rated pretty good."

6035,ChIJ_QNaXHNTUkYRv9dUXWnfDYI,Zee Zee,en,2,1574441993,We were on our way back from sightseeing all day and just wanted to quickly stop in an eat somewhere before we got back to our hotel. Seen this restaurant a long the way and we felt like Italian. Waitress was lovely and the look of the restaurant was super cute! However the food was NOT!!! The pasta was hard and had no flavour at all! The pizza was average if that.Left really disappointed.
6036,ChIJ_QNaXHNTUkYRv9dUXWnfDYI,Sasha Steinbock,en,2,1603614410,"My expectations were low given the previous rating of the place. However I was still let down... The wine was corky and on the edge of being too old, the appetiser was unimpressive and tasted like cheap ingredients, my main course consisted of the most tasteless beef I've ever had (had to drown it in salt and pepper to eat it) and the sause that came with it tasted like flour and water mixed together with a drop of mushroom essens. The dessert was creme brulee and tasted like something they had bough and not made themselves. The only upside to the place was she sweet waitress who did her best to make it a nice meal. We tried a total of 7 different dishes at our table and only the chicken was good, the rest was not worth paying money for. Definitely not worth the visit!"

They get an extra point for offering a take-away bag for the food we ordered but couldn't finish, an excellent idea, and we went home with all the leftovers professionally packed like a TV dinner.

However... The starters were really small, tiny and tasteless. The beef carpaccio was really thick sliced which made it more or less repelling and the so called beef tartar was amongst the worst I've ever had. Super small, lacking in taste and not at all what the menu painted out it to be. We then had the mains.. Pluma which was ok and ribeye supposedly hanged for 35 days.. the ribeye turned out to be sous-vided, and completely lacking of taste. It was simply a boiled peace of unceasoned meat. We ordered medium rare and it was well done at best, but not panfried well-done but cooked. We immediately complained and had no argument, we were immediately offered a new piece of meat, and while it was better than the first one, it wasn't good. We opted out on desserts since the starters and mains was really substandard. The service throughout all of this was excellent, so we actually left a tip but we made it really clear that the tip was towards the service and not the food.

Forthe single room the shower is not designed right: one cannot avoid getting the whole bathroom wet.
The junior suite is divided into two rooms. There are two TV sets, but almost no place for clothes or for hanging your towels.
Breakfast is fine, even during Corona. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, yogurt, juice & coffee and much more.
Another positive thing is the stuff. They are friendly and responsive. If you have a wish or report a problem, it is dealt with promptly.
Getting to & from the room might be difficult during Corona times, since the elevators can be tricky to catch. The stuff did open one of the fire staircases, so it can be used."

Now, for once it is signposted ""Tivoli"" and the Scandic Hotel shows nowhere. Mentioning that to staff, she replied ""Yes, we know, but don't know why"". It would have been good to be advised BEFORE we try to find the hotel parking in that garage. That was not the worst part. Checking out next day, we could not get to the garage, because the card reader for the elevator did not work. And, of course, the service button did not work either. Going back to reception, we were told they would mention that to the service company. We had to find out ourselves that there was another entry via staircase. When mentioning that, they said: oh, yes, there is one. Instead of offing to help getting the luggage via the staircase to the car, they offered just and apology for the inconvenience.

Rooms were not got cleaned, used towels of the day were not replaced with clean towels, in the evening when l asked at reception, I was told that cleaners don't come to room for cleaning or changing towels unless customer have asked them, when I mentioned that how would I as a customer know this policy or procedure, I was told that they should have told me which was not been.
The room itself, was not great when I compare with other hotels in this city of same stars ranking.

The place won on all fronts: the unique location, the nice but relaxed atmosphere, all interior was new and nice, the food was unsurpassed, the price was very reasonable for central Copenhagen, and Christina who is the event coordinator was welcoming and checked (unlike several elsewhere). When the pandemic hit, we only became even happier with our choices. Throughout the process, both Christina, the rest of Humanic (who runs the place), as well as Jerry, the restaurant manager, were incredibly understanding of our somewhat difficult situation. They offered us very good terms in relation to any. cancellation, rebooking of reception, etc., as well as great understanding of our inner chaos of cutting off the guest list and the length of the evening, constant new corona requirements and many many questions from us. They helped us get the perfect wedding in a truly imperfect time where everything was a little surreal.

The party itself stands as a highlight of the pandemic in both our and our guests' memory - the food was completely unsurpassed, the serving was both smiling and invisible, and we felt welcome and safe. Our guests described the restaurant as ""an overlooked gem"" and we can only agree with them.

We already dream of holding all the other big parties in life at Kernen, and we look forward to visiting the restaurant again.
A very big THANK YOU from the Corona-nervous bridal couple, who got everything we had dreamed of, despite.
Emma and Kristian"

6122,ChIJR0vi2gpTUkYRaJ6EB1t2K20,Petteri Pertola,en,3,1626979938,"Rustic, Bohemian Italian restaurant. We had the 4 course menu for 450DKK, which is overpriced compared to what you get.
The ricotta+spinach ravioli was great, as was the dessert ice cream with mint and strawberries, but the other elements in the menu were average at best.
What's worse is that 2 out of 3 warm dishes were served too hot so you had to extinguish your mouth with water, unable to taste the flavor very much.

For the same amount you can get a much better deal in restaurants like Radio.

Bonus points for the service, I wasn't familiar with all the wines so I asked for a recommendation twice, and both times was able to try two different wines to see which one I like best.

1220,- for 2 people with only 2 glasses of wine and one non alcoholic cocktail is about 450kr too much compared to the quality, sadly."

The dumpling skin was thick and doughy and the dumplings were poorly constructed. They looked comical. The wait time was about 20 minutes for two bowls of 12 in total. The fillings were unoriginal and to be honest not that tasty and eating 12 of these dumplings did not make me full.

Given that 12 cost almost 120 kroner, I do not believe these dumplings represent value for money.

They were clearly understaffed. We waited more than 20 minutes and had seen no food coming out of the kitchen. I tried to cancel our order (we went for streetfood due to lack of time) but the waiter didn't know how to do that. She called someone on the phone and left the room and me waiting for five minutes. Then I was told she didn't know how to cancel an order but the food was ready and all the food (4 or 5 orders) would be served at the same time.

We were worried during the first 30 - 40 minutes. The dining experience began with a menu of small snacks. Every snack was extremely good. Tastes and flavor combinations we have not experienced before, and the quality was so top notch that we were worried that ""this was it"" and we would be handed the bill once the snack menu was over. Even so, we agreed that the snack menu was worth the full price, if that was to be our sad faith.

To our utmost joy the snack menu was only the start. We were led upstairs and got several more filling but equally amazing dishes. My only remaining worry is that my girlfriend has informed me that either I learn how to cook Thai food, or our engagement will be called off and she will find herself a Thai boyfriend.

When making the reservation we informed them that my girlfriend is blind, and they were very accommodating and considerate.

Next time we are in Copenhagen we will definitely be back at Kiin Kiin - even with the risk of my girlfriend running away with one of the waiters or cooks!"

Ordered shawarma in homemade pita.
Great tasting fresh bread that was rolled and baked to order.
They use ""real"" shawarma, so pieces of beef which was moist and had great flavour combined with the salad, dressing and chili.

Also, staff seems fine. I've gone there every day for 2 weeks with no issues

Haven't had their pizza yet but the size of them seem easy enough for 1 person to finish. Their prices seem to match very well with how filling each item is relative to t

Edit: After several times its still great tasting pita bread and shawarma.
Chili isn't that great, and the homemade durum bread does not taste homemade. Seems to be as filling as 1 pita.
I'd recommend always getting the homemade pita."

The only reason for me giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because of a single waiter that was extremely kind and smiling while working.

1. The first guy was not happy or enthusiastic and lead us to a dirty table.

2. The menus we had to look it was not cleaned at any point in time.

3. The food was completely dry. They managed to make dry meat soaked in sauce that was pumped full of starches. (Buffets usually put a bit of starch to make the costumer fell full and eat less.)

4. The first cutlery I grabbed still had cheese stuck on it. Grossed me out.

5. The pasta was covered in a layer of starch. That thing tasted like thick water.

Summary: everything was full of starch and too thick. Drinks were wayyy too over priced. Everything felt and was dirty. Food was more dry than recycled paper."

There was no menu to indicate this pricing and the waiter suggests you enjoy a nice cold beverage to enjoy your pizza alongside. I have never felt so ripped off in my life. The food was at best average, and the service was mediocre. Stay away from this place if you want to enjoy the rest of trip in Copenhagen,  because it‚Äôs ruined the rest of mine.

Went to ¬†liberty grill to have some lunch. Would honestly not recommend. ¬†The service was non-existent.¬† At the entrance it states that you have to wait to be placed by a server.¬† It is not ended up being pointed towards a table and them moving on.

They threw a menu on the table and went on.¬† At this point I already knew what I wanted from my wait at the entrance. .¬† I look for an beef tenderloin, however this request was answered with ‚Äúyou have to choose sides‚Äù followed by the waiter leaving right away without taking the side order or even attempting to. Just plainly left at this point.

This is repeated 2-3 times as I am not fast enough to the 3 options. Where a normal place would give you the 3 options and take your order. Here it was just ‚Äúyou need to choose sides‚Äù without waiting the 2 seconds it takes to respond.

I finally managed to order a 200 gram medium rare beef tenderloin with fries, sauce and green salad.

It's a rather sad looking plate that arrived at the table.

I cut the meat and it was not medium rare.¬† Not even Blue.¬† Far from rare and even further from medium rare. Cold center. Meat was probably frozen/near frozen when I was seared. It would have worked fine if the meet was in a sou vide but from cold searing it on a ripping hot pan won‚Äôt lead to a pleasant experience for anyone.

I sit for a while waiting for a waiter to come and ask about the food which is normal service in my optics.¬† (the establishment was not busy at all. maybe 5 tables with 10 customers total and 3 waiters.)

A waiter first comes after I push my plate aside when I have eaten was I myself considered acceptable in terms of personal food safety. He takes the plate and walks away quickly. I was unable to establish contact again.

Would definitely not recommend going here."

1) Food: Like most patrons, we ordered the chef's tastings, which comes with ten courses spread out over a few hours. Wine and drinks are separate from the tasting. To start, four appetizers came out with a warm plate of bread and salted butter. Then a fish dish, meats, endives and two desserts came out. Each dish was solid, but only the kombucha ice cream and one of the appetizers were out of this world.

2) Space: It's a large restaurant with tables throughout the space, including in the windows. We sat at a small table elevated in the window.

3) Location: It's in the trendy meat packing district surrounded by top restaurants and cafes.

4) Price: For an expensive city, our chef's tasting was around $65 per person- not bad compared to other restaurants!

5) Service: It was really good! Our reservations was at 9 p.m., but they let us in around 7:30 p.m. Each server explained each dish in Danish or English. The only odd thing was the spacing. There were large gaps in between courses and the entire experience took three hours."

Only bad thing was the gym, which looks nice but the equipment (except for the rowing cardio machine) is really bad if you really want to train."
6505,ChIJIQgAuAxTUkYREwhuAu591mY,Joana Tischkau,en,1,1632691290,"I had the worst experience ever at this Hotel! The receptionist and chain owner Marc Weinert were extremely rude, racist, and disrespectful towards me!
I had been booked into the Axel Guldsmeden for a business trip, by my danish employer who books with them regularly. I had been told that a double room incl. breakfast and early check-in was booked in my name. But upon my mid-day arrival my booking had been mixed up and I was told I had no breakfast and no early check-in but 2 single rooms.This info completely differed from the original booking which I had confirmation of via email. After a short discussion the receptionist nonetheless gave me a room and asked me to put down the security deposit of 500DK, which I did with my credit card.  When I told her that the original booking should have been prepaid, or paid via invoice by my employer she told me I could solve this problem with my employer by the end of the day. When I wanted to clear the issue in the evening, a different receptionist was at the counter who told me that prepaid booking was not possible and that my booking could not be traced to a company account. When I gave her my employers e-mail information and the booking receipt she was completely unwilling to help and told me she could not access the necessary data as it was Friday evening. She demanded that I pay the room immediately, even though I kindly asked her to give me until the next morning to sort the issue out (even though that should have been her job). She was very insistent and impatient with me as other guests were waiting to check-in. She kept explaining me the same things in a dismissive and patronizing way as if I was too stupid to understand and as if the  mistake was on me as she wasn't able to access the original booking due to the complicated booking system and that it was company policy that rooms had to be paid upon check-in. While this conversation went on I noticed an older white man sitting near the desk, drinking wine by himself. Once he realized that the receptionist had troubles with my request he approached me, stepping into my personal space and asking what my problem was. Little did I know that this drunken man was the owner of the hotel chain; Marc Weinert. When asked who he was, he first told me that he was the manager. He tried to calm me down in a very paternalistic and patronizing way, tone-policing me and offering me wine from the bottle he held in his hand. He asked me repeatedly to explain my issue to him and wanted me to sit down with him 'for a glass of wine'. His behavior felt in no way appropriate for a manager, let alone the owner of the hotel chain. The receptionist repeatedly declined to help me or solve my issue, instead she asked me to pay 'or else...', as other customer waited to be served she said 'you're not the only one to be served' and that I should leave the issue alone or leave the hotel. She several times hinted towards the fact that she believed I couldn't be trusted and therefor could not stay at the hotel if I hadn't paid. By this time Marc Weinert had left the argument as he was too drunk to contribute in any productive way.
I became so frustrated and felt pressured that I paid even though I shouldn't have. I went up to my room to calm myself down and later in the evening tried to confront the receptionist again with her unprofessional behavior, demanded that she solved the issue, refunding my payment and apologize for her racist projections onto me.
When confronted with my allegations she responded with utter defense and white fragility, said that she couldn't possibly be racist as 'her brother was dark-skinned' and even shouted at a black employer walking past if she 'had ever been racist to him'. After another 1.5 hours of discussing, an email from my employer demanding that the issue should be solved and an white friend by my side, she was suddenly able to access the data, invoice the payment to my employer, and reimburse me. :-/"
6506,ChIJIQgAuAxTUkYREwhuAu591mY,Marike,en,1,1630312750,"Very unhelpful, rude receptionist. I made a reservation 5 days ahead and was never informed that I had to pay a deposit of 500 DKK, by VISA only, on top of the room charges. I never had to pay this on my previous visits, I even didn't have to pay my room in advance before. I had only access to my company visa the next morning and they did not accept any other form of payment even not 4x the rooms value in cash untill the next day. So the receptionist threw me out in the middle of the night, in their unsafe neighborhood, unbelievable!"

The place wasn't even busy only 4 tables were occupied (we can understand why with such a bad service) at the moment of getting the bill they were crazy fast and they kept hovering trying to get us to pay when we said we wanted a few minutes to check the bill. The staff is extremely rude even moving the plates of the people that was actually eating still, while they were trying to get some food on the fork. Suffice to say we'll never go back."

Generous portion of the main course and the antipasto/ starter was truly commendable.
House wine, however, was a total disaster and ruined the experience.
I ordered the red wine. It was pungent and carbonic. Had to ask for a new glass which was equally bad.
Music was a tad bit too loud in my opinion. But the bad wine may have contributed to my discountenance.
Seeing that it's called Spaghetteria, I was expecting Italian music, not pop music.

Taste and composition is 5 star overall I would rate it 4/5 because we had to eat a lot of bread to feel full. There is a very comprehensive wine list with nature wine. Which is excellent. However, I went there with my girlfriend and a couple visiting from out of town. From the beginning a French waiter made us feel very unwelcome. Not sure if he aimed to be funny, but it felt like he blamed us for not having looked at the menu when I asked about the concept of the restaurant. The tone was very rude. Looking at their 100reds of bottle wine list I used the Vivino app for pinpointing good bottles. He apparently noticed and when I ordered, I was ridiculed and scolded in front of my guests, making everyone feel uncomfortable. I am a frequent visitor to Michelin restaurants and avid restaurant goer in Copenhagen, I have NEVER experienced anything like this. The rest of the evening I made ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù with the waiter to not spoil the evening. But I cannot critique this enough and find it  EXTREMELY unprofessional. This treatment can really destroy a restaurant and all the good people working there. 1 star."

The bread was not warm and was hard but I was too hungry by the time that it was brought to us to complain about it. The coffee (capuccino) looked nice but was not very tasty. They did not have any gluten free pastries only the bread. My sandwich and coffee were about 140 dkk. Overall, would not go again and would not recommend.üëé"

The basic menu starts from 89KR (~12‚Ç¨) including burger, fries and sauce and then you can additionally put some extras.

Burger patty was cooked perfectly, the vegetables were supeer fresh and tasty and the brioche bun was just as perfect as it can get. Fries were also super tasty and cheese sauce was not too ‚Äúartificial‚Äù if you understand.

For dessert definitely take one of their ice cream shakes.

I will be back for sure!"

Me and 2 boys tried Big Bite Burger for the first time via Wolt. We were not particularly impressed with the supermarket-purchased burger buns.

The steak tasted like it came from frost. We ate half up, all before we had to eat our fill of the french fries, which was almost the only positive experience with their chili mayo.

1.5 hours after we have eaten, we all get a stomach ache, which can not be a coincidence. 2 of us got cold sweats which continued for 2-3 hours. Thank God we are all fresh again the next day, despite nausea all night.

Despite the request, the ""restaurant"" does not want to refund for the bad food, as they do not think it may be their food that is to blame for the above.

Whether it was the burger, fries or chili mayo that was bad, I dont know. There has been something bad in their food.

My biggest recommendation - stay far away from this place."

The view from the 12th floor makes the experience even better.

The only negative thing there is to say, is that the noise level can be really loud - because the place is so popular and crowded."

Our reservation was for 5:45 p.m. (all six of us arrived on time) but at 7:45 p.m., a member of the management staff rude and arrogantly told us, ""You must leave now."" We realize that the restaurant has a two-hour table policy. However, it was the manner in which this individual told us to leave that was really upsetting to us (and our companions). It was not necessary for him to be so harsh or arrogant. We were mainly upset by the fact that we still had wine in our glasses, and that there were at least 4-5 additional tables available. We politely inquired whether we might finish our wine but he insisted that we leave. He said people were waiting - which happened to be a lie! This individual is in need of some basic customer service skills! We have traveled to restaurants around the world, and we have NEVER experienced such rudeness. It is a miracle that a business like this can stay open with such lack of customer service"
6869,ChIJ7apb5W1TUkYR9lAFpZjKE1E,Karoline Christensen,en,5,1633859070,"Amazing view!
The food was absolutely amazing! Probably one of the best streaks I've ever eaten. Or should I say three as me and my partner got the MASH World Tour.
All the sides are truly incredible. I strongly recommend getting the Creamed Spinach, Broccolini and Truffle Fries.
The service was really nice and would make sure our water, drinks and sauces were always full. Extremely positive experience.
I would recommend dressing up a little as this is not a casual place.
The restaurant was full at all times, which did mean there were a lot of noise.
If you want to go to a less busy/loud place go to their Bredgade location as I find that it's usually less busy, but the exact same service and quality of food.

Overall it was a truly extraordinary experience!!

Reading some of the other reviews, people have had issue with the bill and service, but my group had no problems with either."
6870,ChIJ7apb5W1TUkYR9lAFpZjKE1E,Nicolas Janus,en,2,1633506726,"Lost reservation and because it was full we were not able to get in. Not a big deal, but it is not the first time. When I was able to access, sometime ago, meat was not as good as expected. It was also very difficult to have the correct cooking: I received rare but I asked for well-done. Some wine never arrived on the table, but it arrived on the bill! So I would advice to check the receipt. The bar did not want to provide me a receipt for a beer as well, for a reason beyond my comprehension."

‚ÄúThanks for last Friday, you have been very helpful.
Unfortunately we are fully staffed, but I will keep it in mind if we will need your help in the future.
Anyways, here in Huset you can help us and get a volunteer card, which will give you access to discounts to shows and bars in Huset, and we can offer you a nice meal and a beer or a glass of nice wine, free of charge, for every shift you will work with us.""

The staff was inattentive and the service was incredibly slow. Went there to enjoy some coffee and cocktails in the afternoon. There were few people at the restaurant, but we still had to wait for over 20 minutes before the first coffee arrived. The coffee was cold, and the cappuccino foam looked more like bath water. The others got theirs 7 minutes later. The cocktails tasted like they were supposed to. One of the drinks never came, even after repeating the order.

When the people on the next table got their food, they asked the waitress why they hadn‚Äôt received their drinks yet. She said she didn‚Äôt know and apparently didn‚Äôt care. So they sat there with a full table of warm food and nothing to drink.

After searching for a waitress to be able to pay, I told her that this had not been a very pleasant experience and that we hadn‚Äôt even got everything we ordered. She did not care at all. I will never go there again."

When we were in the room,  we usually opened the doors to the balcony which overlooked a lesser used entrance to the station.  You can see people walking and riding their bikes while talking and laughing. There was even a street musician a block away that we could hear.  Closing the doors provided the quiet we needed to sleep; I only heard what sounded like thunder rumbling in the distance and this was rare.

The room was clean and the service was great.  The temperature in the room was perfect but that might be because the highs that week never reached above 72.

Let it be said that some details are not that impressive i.e. it's a tiny pointless rooftop pool and the main entrance is from busy street into the smallest reception area. But the wonderful spacious well-decorated rooms, friendly staff, the Tivoli Gardens, delicious breakfast options and just the general ambience makes it a world class choice."

Its the things that you shouldnt have to think about that detracted from the visit.  The steak knife was SO DULL that I ate my 70 Euro steak with the butter knife--tearing it more than cutting it.  When asking nicely for a sharper knife that might have a better chance to cut the steak I was told that they were all that dull by both the waitress and the maitre d' who said they knew and a lot of others had complained as well, but the owner wouldn't get new knives.  Freaking seriously? Supposed to be one of the nicer streakhouses in  Copenhagen and you know people are complaining about something as small as the cutlerly and you won't spend the money to replace it.....but still charge 120 Euro a person to eat?  Its the smaller things that RUIN a customers visit and not being able to cut your expensive steak and tearing it apart into chunks is one of them.
Decent ribeye that was cooked very well.  Lacked flavor--No seasoning at all.
Mushroom in gravy appetizer was amazing.  Really really loved it."

We loved how these talented people were also serving us food and drinks all night with a smile and high professionalism. On top of that, the food was downright amazing.

They were clearly busy as we came in, but we Mariano greeted us with the most warm and genuine welcome! We were sat right away and our server introduced himself and explained how the wine servings work- very smart: we‚Äôd pick the wine we want and would be given the whole bottle. At the end, they would measure how much we drank and we‚Äôd only be charged for that amount. Genius and so fun! I explained the kind of wine taste I wanted and our server brought out a bottle. As we tried it, Mariano came back and ‚Äúreverse engineered‚Äù it by looking at the label and explaining the taste- exactly how I had requested at the beginning. LOL what a riot and so impressive! Mariano‚Äôs food recommendations were spot-on with our preferences and all of the dishes were were made with excellent sauces.

6984,ChIJvY9hWg5TUkYR1jm4WtjFTkc,Austin Graff,en,4,1635799583,"Hotel SP34 is a Brochner Hotel in the Latin Quarter of Copenhagen. After spending four nights and five days at Hotel SP34 in October 2021, here's our experience:

1) Location: If you love being close to the tourist attractions and shopping, it's a perfect location. Close to a Metro station, you can take it or walk to Tivoli Gardens and other famous sites. Just a little east of the hotel is a main street with tons of high end shopping and restaurants. My friend and I like more local neighborhoods, so it's not our style, but if you love shopping and tourist locations, it's ideal!

2) Space: It's a spacious hotel that makes good use of the space. There's a large lobby with seats and desks for working. There's an outdoor patio, a rooftop patio, several restaurants, a bar, a gym and a cinema for guests to use.

3) Design: The lobby is designed with quirky paintings and a ""Hello Gorgeous"" sign in the pink elevator. It's a little trendy, but when you enter the rooms, the design becomes classier.

4) Rooms: For two people, we booked the superior double room and keep in mind it's Europe- the rooms are small! With a smaller bed and not much space to retreat, one of us ended up in the lobby at all times to get the space.

5) Amenities: This is where they shine! In the mornings, they have a table with towels, water bottles and running routes set out. There's free wine from 5pm-6pm and free liqueur from 10pm-11pm daily. Our room came with breakfast and wow! It's in a beautiful space on the basement level and comes with a mimosa bar, a bread area, granola, eggs, sausage, so many good food option. They also have a full coffee area.

A few things to keep in mind when staying:

1) Price: Compared to other hotels in the area, it's on the more expensive side.

2) Room: A few things were wrong with our room. The bathroom handle kept breaking off. Also, our shower was slow to drain, often flooding the bathroom after a 5-10 minute shower."
6985,ChIJvY9hWg5TUkYR1jm4WtjFTkc,Jessica Patchett,en,1,1626902841,"Do not recommend. Pitches itself as accommodating, high-end hotel, but it is far from this.

My main complaint is that they played really loud and distracting music (punk-rock, trance inspired hip hop and experimental indie rock) in the restaurant. My father who is hearing impaired even complained about it which is extremely rare.

If they had a more relaxed atmosphere I'd give them a perfect score."

We were a bunch of Indian teenagers who desperately craved Indian food after spending 8 days in Denmark as a part of an exchange trip. The owner opened up his restaurant way before time seeing some hungry Indian kids in front of his restaurant. We were delighted by the setting of the restaurant and took a seat. Short on funds, we started getting up after taking a glance at the menu( the pricing was honestly justified but since it was our last day in Denmark, we were all very short on funds). Seeing this, the owner stepped in and told us that we were all like his kids and he wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to go out of his restaurant hungry. He treated us all( a group of 15) with free food. The food was simply magnificent and all of us walked out with bellies full and contented hearts. I will suggest guru 10/10.

To the owner- Uncle, if you‚Äôre reading this, we would like to tell you that we will be forever grateful to you and it was the best Indian meal outside India which we ever had. Thank you so much for the humanity shown. We promise to pay you back someday üôå"

The dessert consisting of ice cream was tasteless.

Overrated and overpriced...

There were practically none, just some really tiny bits of onions and paprika. 98% of this dish is noodles in a fat sweet chili sauce. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and the place in itself is nice. OK for a beer.
UPDATE, June 2021 (Original comment was from summer 2020):
I've been back. They now have a vegetarian salad that is absolutely OK, and my wife was very happy with her burger. I have the impression they've  raised the quality of the menu since last year. And it's still a nice place for a drink, and the prices are OK if you consider the location.
So I'm adjusting my ""stars"" from two last year, to four this year."

7019,ChIJkU-vsw1TUkYRG0uKDo8eIM8,Pamela Mu√±oz,en,1,1596112307,"Beautiful restaurant but terrible service.

A friend and I met for coffee here and provided menus when seated. We had a look at the extensive menu but had decided that we were only doing coffee today. No one approached the table even though all the wait staff were walking around aimlessly, waiting to greet incoming guests.

When I asked if we could order, I was told to go to the counter. This is common in many establishments but there was no indication that's how this place functioned.

The coffee was an astronomical price (DKK49 for a cortado) but it was pretty tasty and at just the right temperature. The coffee came with a packet of sugar - no little chocolate or biscotti or cookie, which would be the norm at places like this and at those prices.

When we asked for a little cookie, they said we can buy a cookie at the counter. My friend insisted she wasn't going to spend more for something that should come with the coffee, so the waitress said she would look into it for us. Her manager walked over and said that the coffee would normally come with a small biscotti but they were all out. No other alternative was offered. Again, my friend insisted that she find a creative solution.

She said she could inquire with her manager to see what she could do. Finally, they brought over a croissant cut in half to accompany the coffee, which was very much appreciated.

We had to ask three times for something that should have been included, and made to feel like we were asking for the world. Plus, the staff was rude and unhelpful.

In most Burger King restaurants, the meals are huge (they have different sizes and you can choose the real big one), but in this one you couldn't get a big meal. The price was really high for the quality and quantity offered. Copenhagen may be an expensive city, but we had much better lunches with the same amount of money."

It's not huge but they have a nice backroom area where you can also wine and dine.
We were greeted by a funny but passionate waiter/manager, called Emil, I subsequently found out. He immediately made us all feel at home and after I made the mistake of ordering two bowls of chips ( thinking pommes frites) he gave us a nice bowl of almonds on the house. They have an excellent wine list that is very reasonable and we had a nice bottle of Sp√§tburgunder along with some excellent Spanish beer.
It was highly personalised and both Emil and a girl, who was also working that evening called Nina, just had such great humour and passion that made this little oasis stand out. It definitely will not be the last time we visit."

That is not to hold it against those actually working the shift, it could be just plain under staffing.
But getting what was supposed to be a gourmet burger, turned out to be a cold bun, even colder blue cheese smearing (and way too much of it) with ice cold onions and sun dried tomatoes, all surrounding a grey roasted, luke warm, dry and unappealing beef burger.
Very disappointing, and I am never going back."

Jakob Klara and the Kitchen staff really made us want to just stay there forever.

We shared everything on the table, and we just told Jakob to play around and serve what he thought we should taste.

We had Burratta, Crab, Lobster, rimmed cod, the best chicken I ever had and side salads that tasted like heaven. you could taste that everything  were made with the best possible ingredients, and that they despite the fact that every dish only costed around 100 DKK, it were constructed with curiosity and skill.

To drink we had wines by the glass, and we went from a really nice Cava, and got two fantastic white wines including an untraditional but incredibly  well crafted and highly interesting Sancerre. The red wine with the chicken were light but still well bodied.

Over all experience: the menu is small, but everything on it is well crafted and I can highly recommend to order a lot of different dishes, and then share it!

Also, the wine is worth it‚Äòs extra money. But if I want a fine dining experience which I‚Äôm happy to pay, I want time to savor the experience in return."

The Phat khing had an unpleasant strange sweet taste and didn't taste like ginger at all even though it's a ginger sauce stir fry. The fish cakes were bland and it seemed like they had been cooked in oil that was too cold or something because they had soaked up lots of oil like sponges and all the oil seeped out when you cut into them.

I asked for some chili powder or sauce to add just a bit of flavour to the food and was told that I have to pay extra to get chili. Seriously? A Thai restaurant charging extra for a tiny bit of chili is like a Danish restaurant charging you for salt."

My potatoes were roasted to charcoal on one side - not just a little, but completely inedible and unfortunately packed with the peas, which had taken a taste of it. I do not understand that they choose to serve it when it is so obvious that they had ruined the food. One of the two stars is for the tiramisu. It was made on whipped egg whites instead of mascarpone and tasted of cream buns. It had nothing to do with tiramisu, but I like cream buns! My son's burger was ok without being good.

All was perfectly matched with wine surprises from Thorsteinsson's with whom they share address. All in all this was a great food experience.

You eat on a pirate ship in the middle of Tivoli Gardens on the lake... wow! The view is amazing, the tables are slightly awkward on a little angle and the service was pretty good!  We got the large appetizer plank to share and while most was tasty, it did taste slightly reheated and generic.  As others have said there are so many amazing options for food in the park, unless you really want the experience of eating on the ship (which is awesome!) I would say to try somewhere else."

I was contemplating whether to go to McDonald's or this establishment for a quick meal on the train, as it would leave in ten minutes. As I have never ordered anything here, I decided to give them a shot.

There were two ladies in front of me and four employees working. One as a cashier and three making the food. Awesome, this will be quick.

I was wrong. I noticed that others in front of me had been waiting for over ten minutes for a simple milkshake. The employees were taking their time, while knowing it's a fast food establishment and people have to catch their trains. One employee kept hiding in the back every now and then. The other two kept messing orders up (they said it out loud and you could read it from their body language).

It seems like they use an easy to difficult type of process. Easy orders get done before the ones that take more time, even though the people placing these difficult orders have been waiting longer.

My number was 81. Number 77 had to wait until 85 got their order. They got up to 96 before I got my order. I waited for fifteen minutes and missed my train. Luckily for me, the next train left in an hour, so I had no rush anymore.

To make things even better, the place was trashed. Tables were dirty, fries were lukewarm, and the floor was a mess.

What a disappointment. Awful start of my weekend. Won't go back here anymore."

The food took forever to arrive and given how overcooked everything was , from the rock hard burger buns to the  tough as leather chicken coujons, I'm not surprised! Exorbitant prices and underwhelming portion sizes to say the least. This is not a restaurant I would recommend to anyone, at any time. Not even if they were giving the food away for free, would I consider it a good  deal. I'd buy an undercooked chicken burger from a beach vendor in Sri Lanka before I came back to Brdr Price!"

One waiter was really excellent, but a couple were a little moody.

The food was nice, but not outstanding.

The rest of the food was very nice.

We went there yesterday in need of a great draught IPA after lockdown. Met by a lovely lady at reception who did the necessary COVID checks, all very friendly and nice. Went inside and was greeted by a super nice French waiter called Alexi. One of our group had a milk allergy so he was really great in handling this and reconfirming all our orders. Food was really nice and a nice twist on some classic Danish Frokost dishes. We liked them so much we even called the chef out to compliment him.
Now of course you're asking how about the beer?
I tried two, the IPA's, the barman was really friendly in describing them both and recommending the order of trying them. Even my wife was raving about her's and she's not your typical IPA fan. All in all a great experience and one I shall return to."

I had the oxburger which is their signature pulled beef burger. It was one of the best burgers I ever tried! My wife had a veggie burger which was amazingly delicious too. If I ever visit again I‚Äôll definitely come back to try the other burger they have. I love their history story, which you can find on the wall. One of the highlights of our visit to Copenhagen!"
7388,ChIJq7rMLqhUUkYRQgfocUXEUG0,Matthias Smit,en,5,1635055649,My family ate one of the best burgers we have ever had. The vegetarian version was also great. Nice small talk with the cook and tips for our stay in Copenhagen.
7389,ChIJq7rMLqhUUkYRQgfocUXEUG0,Samuel Johnson,en,5,1635121505,Hello Jeppe! Greetings from NC USA! It has been 2 months since we were last in Copenhagen. Valerie and I were just talking about how good your burgers were! Thanks again for your great burgers and service! Highly recommended! Remain safe and well my friend!
7390,ChIJBe7RGBBTUkYRx0ZBWNwUXOA,P Holahan,en,4,1632772655,Very good location. Can be a bit of street noise/parties but nothing too bad. Rooms good. Lobby very nice. Breakfast good. Staff very friendly and helpful. However more than a couple of minor slip ups. Feels more like a top 4 star rather than strong 5 star but I would stay there again.
7391,ChIJBe7RGBBTUkYRx0ZBWNwUXOA,Sebastian Norling,en,5,1635591525,"Very nice hotel! Service was excellent, rooms were clean and spacious and the breakfast was really nice (but a bit too expensive). I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs rare to find a hotel this good for the price we paid, extremely good value for money. Next time in Copenhagen I would definitely be staying here again, and highly recommend it to anyone else going to Copenhagen."
7392,ChIJBe7RGBBTUkYRx0ZBWNwUXOA,Jean-Pierre Perissard,en,4,1635071883,Upgraded to a top floor exterior looking room which was worth it. Otherwise the other rooms give on an inside atrium. You cannot open the windows and obviously have no view. Otherwise this large hotel has a decent breakfast place and pleasant common areas. Overall decent value for money.

On the small downsides - wifi was very weak, making it almost impossible to use. Spa would've been nice to have too.
Would definitely stay again nevertheless."
7395,ChIJBbXOKA5TUkYR2VSBXcf-zA8,Rich Westman,en,5,1631943550,The most amazing dining experience of our trip.

Highly recommended.

I was less than impressed with the upkeep on the dining area... Tries to feel like a pop-up restaurant, though it's been here for a couple years so, yeah."
7406,ChIJAwgQSQ5TUkYRzw1CaiwN17w,Diego Alonso,en,4,1454264754,"Pleasant Nordic cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. The dishes are well prepared and mainly based on fish. The wine pairing is made from French wineries. It fits well the food and the wines are well balanced. The prices are fair and the staff is helpful and knowledgeable, but missing the surprise in both the food and wines"
7407,ChIJAwgQSQ5TUkYRzw1CaiwN17w,Michael Salmony,en,4,1460062500,super friendly service. relaxed atmosphere. really fun theatrical food. super g&t and wines. hilarious crockery. fair price for the quality. a real joy all round.

The great and/weird ingredients that should have been in focus,  was overpowered by way top many other ingredients. Simplicity is the way to go,  less is more. Seems like the kitchen lost some innovation and sharpness lately."
7409,ChIJAwgQSQ5TUkYRzw1CaiwN17w,Jackie Kong,en,5,1496066726,"SO delicious! If you like surprise menus, Bror is a must.

Probably the 2nd best Thai restaurant we have ever eaten at (the 1st had cooks that used to cook for the king and queen of Thailand)."

The portions were rather small, but quite filling, so we did not leave hungry. There is a nice small collection of books related to cooking in the larger dining room area."

I have now been there several times and the service, food and atmosphere is always amazing. The prices are quite good, especially for this location.

The food might now be traditionally Japanese, but they are made with love for both the produce and the art of cooking itself. It is one of the places which I do not tire to return to.

Give it a visit if you are in Copenhagen."

7420,ChIJc_f6Lw5TUkYRAtTI0Phy22s,K. Gnu Jern,en,5,1622299350,"This is not traditional Asian food, but it is crazy good food, made by people that obviously know their way around in the kitchen, the Asian cuisine as well as international cuisine in general.

The food is phenomenal, very balanced and yet never the same. Very simple at first sight, but very well made, with the odd twist of something not so simple (often something fermented).

Whether you order a main dish and a beer, or go full monty on their tasting menu, you will have a proper, meal that will make you wish for more, without needing it - if you need more ask for it, and you will be served with a smile.

Owner and chef vividly and very happily will tell you what you're eating and how it's made. And, if possible timewise, always find time and enjoy to a talk about different techniques, sake and stories of the area.

The owner and his wife is the primal force of the place, and I will dare to say that you will have to look very thoroughly for people more invested in a restaurant, more pleasant and casual company than these two.

Fine dining camouflaged as casual dining."

The guy in charge says he closses soon (22:30) when the official time is 01:00. The cafe/bar was empty and thought of getting an coffee/drink while working. I will avoid any other time I go to the center.
PD: Saw the answer fomr the owner. If you tell that your place is a bar and not an office, why do you prefer to lie with the time? Just tell me you don't allow people working with computers and I will find another place. Avoid this place."

At least not for us. There is no good service. Strange experience. We hurried to drink our beer so we could move on. Most focus is on regular customers, which I can also see others have written in their reviews. The place could also well use a proper cleaning."

Now after the owner has replied, can also add that the owner is super rude and uprofessional. If you can't take critisism and answer why your food is so salty, maybe it is you who should't own a restaurant?"

The scallops were especially good.  They have some tables set aside just for people eating at Hav, but my big complaint is that there is no water.  That aside, recommended."

The menu is carefully put together to give you an extraordinary experience, from the first bite till the last drop of wine. You can learn about each dish from the staff, who tell you about its origin and its process. All the dishes in their menu are a combination of Italian principles and local ingredients. Clearly there are long hours of study and experimentation behind.
The passion they put into what they do is undeniable and I like to imagine the chef waking up at night with great ideas about the next menu.

We were charged the full price, despite not actually being served what we ordered. I asked the staff why he didn't inform us about the lack of fresh fruit when we ordered the waffles, and he answered that he'd forgotten about it. I then spotted another customer having a meal with a bowl of assorted fresh fruits and pointed this out. Staff told me that this was not the ""appropriate"" type of fresh fruit to serve with waffles.

A week ago I tried to place a very late Friday order via the third party delivery provider, but the order was being processed forever, so I stopped trying. We ordered take away at the other place that night.

The next day I got a call from Hind: they asked whether I would pick up my order. Apparently Jojo created an order for Saturday instead, and Hind was waiting for us to pick up our order...

I am grateful for the professionalism of the Hind management. They returned the money, even though the food was clearly already prepared.

It was a very uncomfortable situation that we offered to pay for the leftovers that we actually ordered and not the extra ones that we did not order. They offered for us to take away everything for 100kr. But the fact that we had to engage in a heated discussion for a mistake that was not our fault is not at all pleasant.

She got it exchanged for eggs with shrimp. Which I also ate. The prawns were very salty and it ruined the food. The roast beef was good but NOK 110 for a piece of roast beef is on the high side.

The staff was a young woman who spoke English. She was NOT wearing gloves when serving and had planted her finger directly on the plate with our food. In these Corona times !!

Elsewhere, they change gloves between EVERY customer. She did NOT wear gloves.

When she had to take out the bad fish fillet, she stuck her head down CLOSE

The food was delicious, but throughout the night we ended up falling in love with some of the staff over mutual love for an Irish comedian and dogs. For us, this was a Michelin star restaurant that didn't seem to take themselves to seriously - they definitely took the food seriously and spent time and care for the plating, but there was self deprecating humor and sarcasm spread throughout the evening for us, which we appreciated, because we love that type of humor.

Check in was lovely and Christina took items to my room since bell captain was absent.

Breakfast is nice and orderly. Workers are pleasant.

JOHN at the bar is a dream! The best drinks and perfect way to end the day after walking 30,000 steps.
John also suggested restaurants for us to try and we plan on visiting the bar again-what a treasure you have in John!!

The room is clean and yet a bit small.
The hotel is beautiful and centrally located and easy to get around by foot or bike (but not car).
The sleeping temperature in the room is uncomfortable and the thermostat does nothing to help the problem.
Parking is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and you have to schlep your bags back through city traffic.

The wine hour they have is a great idea, was surprised when they told me about it when I arrived and found it quite a bold move. Room is super tiny for the price you pay, too bad that there‚Äôs no space for the luggage. No mini bar in the room too. Breakfast is so good. Smoothies were the best! Rooftop is pretty nice, but now, the season is over to fully enjoy it. Will come back in spring/summer to give it a try!"
7761,ChIJeVFZNRJTUkYRmo0TNDNliS8,HK Spacecadet,en,3,1634625953,"Great design and location, very friendly staff, but rooms a bit on the dark side with black walls, black ceilings, and minimum lighting in the bathrooms. Lack of amenities, like only two towels for two people, no ropes, no slippers.

All drinks/alcohol for free in the hotel. Quite impressive, and they are very generous with it, but one gets a feeling that it‚Äôs a bit of a party hotel. Some will love this, for others it‚Äôs a waste.

Very good breakfast, but an impossible chaos when u show up Saturday morning at 9 am, no seating, no food, just disappointed guests, that end up having their breakfast in the lobby. Hey, if you don‚Äôt have space then inform guest to sign up for a slot when checking in, then you also don‚Äôt look like a bunch of amateurs on opening day‚Ä¶

We stayed in a suite, which is actually not a suite, but a room big enough to accommodate a sofa as well. Which is really pushing it at 400 EUR per night.

All good and nice, but too expensive for what you get."

The wine hour is a great concept- the rooftop terrace is fun abd offers some decent views. Rooms in the older wing are spacious enough with the beds on a slightly smaller side, but otherwise functional and practical. Breakfast is a decent spread. Lobby bar and street side seating are great on a sunny evening!!! Liked our stay - not to forget location very close to public transport and walking distance to a lot of places."

With just one change you can get there easily from the airport. The metro (line 2)is the easiest way to get into town from the airport. A great selection at the breakfast buffet with many organic products. Many shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. They also have a rooftop terrace where you can see the highest Tivoli attractions.

I‚Äôve never experienced such an inflexible restaurant when it comes to payment. It wasn‚Äôt even busy when we tried to leave so the staff had plenty of time to handle our request."

(We ordered fried fish fil√©t with shrimps and caviar on top, but it was served without any caviar at all - the mistake was corrected though after I pointed it out)

The best thing about the place is that it's cozy, located right next to the pond inside Tivoli gardens, offering great views.

Staff was a mixed bunch, some were really nice and friendly, others appeared to be annoyed when you needed their attention.

So overall, 3 stars."

We then waited another 10 minutes until she decided to come back and clean the table. Then another 10 minutes to take our order. We waited forever and food was overpriced.
Never again. I don't know why the good reviews, honestly. And there was no fish and chips like shown in the pictures.

In its current location the food has downgraded so much that I was embarrassed to even have suggested it to the folks I went with. It is undefendable.

Edit: the owners claim we didn't eat there, which is absurd and false. For good measure we attach the receipt of the highly over priced menu, with our promise that we will never return."

My best restaurant of 2021 !

My 2019 review: Expensive but totally worth it. I took the sushi menu and was blown away by the creativity, the tastes (plural) and service. They are at the level of a Michelin guide star.

The cocktails could have been a bit better balanced, but overall diverse and tasty. Things like limoncello spritz, basil pisco sour, dark'n'stormy.

Good price for the food, but we definitely ended up spending more on drinks and water than expected. Had to remove a star due to the extremely slow service. 2h into our visit we were only served 4 of the 10 servings."

The halibut was too salty, but the bread and the sauce still made it delicious. The roast pork was nicely done, the skin was crispy and tasted similar to the Chinese roast pork. I also really enjoyed the sides: browned potatoes, cabbage, pickled cucumber, which usually aren't my favorite, but I ate all of it. I sat outdoor and enjoyed the quieter atmosphere from the otherwise busy city center.  It also started raining at the end of the meal, and I felt it was the perfect place to be."

The food was  brilliant. As a starter we had fried scallops and a french fish soup, they soup was one of the best fish soups I have had in my life. As a main course my girlfriend got Tatar and she just loved it, the fusion with truffle oil is great. I got Tournedos Rossini and was superb. They have really good french red wines in good value of money. The service was top, our waiter was really passionated for his job and he had great knowledge for wines.

I commented it but the waiter just said in a cocky way that it was because of corona and that they maybe would go back to the prices of the sign in a month or two. I found it weird - you cannot advertise a price on something and then charge way more.

7986,ChIJj4FcBkhTUkYRhojE_ivTeMU,Tina Droob,en-US,2,1633603436,"We were 5 happy guests who had booked a table, both by purely physical attendance in Chums Vinbar & Deli and subsequently we had, for the sake of good order, confirmed the order by email for approx. 3 weeks ago.

Unfortunately, neither order was written down and the small place was booked up by other guests.

The sympathetic owner couple, found a table after we refused to consume cheese fondue on the small children's table tables at the entrance, but it undeniably put a damper on the expectation of being an expected guest.

The ingredients are perfectly fine, but it was clear that the owners had not counted on the number of guests they had taken in and therefore, there was at no time enough bread.

The worst thing in that regard, though, was that one host, simply emptied a bread bowl, from a company that left their table, into our bread bowl, to have enough bread, it's not okay at all.

I'm sorry this review does not trigger 5 stars, for the hosts were sweet but it does not offset that we were both forgotten, missing bread, and almost worst, that we got the leftovers from another company's bread bowl, resulting in 2 stars.

I would also like to recommend that you either give portion-served cheese fondue to each one, or make sure that there is a fork for each plate, the current concept triggers that people use the fondue fork as a eating tool that smokes in and out of the mouth, as there are no other options, and a couple of our guests found this part rather challenging."

Very loud inside (horrible acoustics) so you can't even hear what the person on the other side of the table is saying.
Food wise, classic does not mean good. The sm√∏rrebr√∏d was cheap but incredibly average and nondescript compared to Cafe Wilders for example.
Great, funny service and an emblem of the past however."

Definitely one of the better tasting pizzas in Copenhagen, I've been there twice, tried a pizza and a sandwich, both were very good, not the overly oily cheese you normally get from other places. Will definitely pay them another visit.

If you like gyros with stale meat (barely could find any), carrots and cabbage, look no further. I ate 6 hours ago and still cannot digest. Shame on you who think this is acceptable.

Previously the food was gods food. I would come there regularly for last 2 years and enjoy the lovely serving. I miss that so much, it was one of few decent street food places in inner  CPH.

It looks that the new guys are milking the cow until it lasts but this is just disrespectful. I suggest the new owners try what they serve themselves."

8040,ChIJYerkJLhTUkYRTh7MBgmAx3g,Rajesh Bachani,en,2,1612043928,"We ordered some food using a downtown coupon, and the food was not great quality.
The butter chicken and chicken curry dishes had chicken which was very hard and somehow didn't feel fresh.
One of the curry dishes seemed to have too much turmeric in it, just by the taste of it. Probably a very Nepalese style of cooking. Generally Indian dishes also have turmeric, but not so much in quantity that it overpowers the taste of the dish.
Lamb curry dish was good in taste, but the lamb again was very hard and was a little pink from inside.
We were just not satisfied with the food, and thought there are several better places paying the same amount of money for some really good and quality food.
I would most probably not be going there again."

The restaurant does deals on deal sites, so we got a main course plus appetizer, pre-appetizer, naan and a very small salad for the price of less than the main course itself. The mango lassi was great, too. The only downside is the mango lassi came in a plastic box rather than cups, which meant we had nothing to drink from when we ate the food outside nearby rather than taking it home.
Service needs some work, though. The woman who mans the front desk also does some cooking, which means it was necessary to call to get service. Otherwise you can wait quite a while.
Order ahead and take home and you'll get a great meal!"

The waitress who served our table seemed to be having a bad day or something, she was borderline rude. I actually never experienced this kind of attitude in any other place in Denmark before, so it was a bit shocking.

She seemed really irritated to answer any questions we have. (we asked what kind of dessert they have today)

Also, coffee was quite good but all of our orders came separately with long waiting time. We ordered 2 desserts and 4 drinks, received desserts first, then 10 minutes later 2 coffees, then 15 minutes later 2 other drinks. (I honestly think they forgot two of our orders and remembered later)

Yes, it was a busy day at the cafe and yes, they seemed a bit understaffed but when I asked this waitress when my drink is coming, she immediately got defensive and told me with a stone cold face that it‚Äôs coming. No explanation or apology. :/

Seating was very cramped - I was literally squeezed in between the table and the espresso machine (which was fortunately not used while I was there).

The staff were efficient servers, but they didn't make the visit feel special. I don't expect us to become best friends, but it would've been nice if they'd at least presented the food."

Delivery was bad. I don't fault the restaurant for this since it was through Wolt. But my food was cold. Fries were ready to be discarded when they arrived.

The burger was cold but edible. I was mostly disappointed by the size.

226 kr. to feed one person. I feel totally ripped off. Not worth it by any stretch. Will not repeat. Order from Jagger or maybe even Halifax if you're gonna spend this kind of cash. You will get 3x more food for your money, at a much better quality.

boy was i wrong
only one of the sandwiches that i ordered were right. One of the other sandwiches we had ordered came without half of what was supposed to be on it, they even manged to forget the salad. ended having to make more food when we got home because of the lack thereof
the other one was ordered with tzatziki and on arrival they said they were out of it and asked if it was okay that they replaced it with garlic sauce we said fine and then when there wasn't any chicken i the bowl he pulled out a plastic bag from under the counter with chicken.
wow.
needless to say the chicken was inedible and ended up just being thrown away.

I ordered the Thai marinated salmon whihc was lukewarm and slightly undercooked in the middle, someone else at the table ordered a Thai green curry which was lukewarm. My salmon only a good 10 minutes after the rest of the table. We ordered both the starters and the mains at once and everything came at once whihc was a lot of food and left us feeling over loaded.

My favorite locations are Niels Hemmingsens Gade, Hellerup, Vesterport St. and sometimes I also visit Frederiksberg.

The patty is good meat which you can taste but also feel after eating the burger, the bun is special and unlike most other buns only available at Gasoline Grill and another high end burger restaurant.

The pickles are also a special brand, and the sauce is what makes the burger special.

If you want soft onions, just ask for an Oklahoma style cheeseburger and you'll be one step closer to extra deliciousness.

If you prefer your burger medium or well done just say so as well when you order :)

There is sometimes a bit of turnover of staff (i.e. new hires) which can affect the experience a bit, but the meat and other ingredients are generally one step higher than the competition still."

If you dont order drinks and eat only food there, the waitress look at you in an awkward way and she does it all the time - its much evident on their faces (Last time I asked her why is that so and she didnt reply).

We came here on a Friday, mostly because it's been a while. Dalle Valle has always been dull and uninspired pretty much no matter which way you look at it, but usually ""good enough"" for a quick meal.
This time they've hit rock bottom. Their meat and fish was so overcooked that it was barely edible. Their salad buffet was reduced to maybe a third of their previous selection, and nothing looked appetising. The flavour was absent enough that I considered calling in a detective to chase it down.
Surprisingly, the disappointment extended into areas you wouldn't expect: the fresh fruit tasted a bit like cardboard (I don't know how they managed to mess that up, there is fresh tasty fruit in Bilka just one floor below), and the draft beer was flat.
There was one redeeming quality, though: the pizza baker. I suspect they hired him having seen the succes of the pizza bakery in the next-door Cypress buffet restaurant (which has a much nicer salad buffet and a good hummus as well) . Granted, the pizzas are good. Almost good enough to make up for the man's disgruntled face expression.

8491,ChIJPyNOkxNTUkYRAI43yR_6WZo,Soyoung Park,en,1,1547131548,"Well I liked the food. But they are racists. Here we go.

First, they made me wait for good 15 minutes (I politely waited in front of the ""wait to be seated"" sign) pretending like they never noticed me (I was literally in their face) maybe because I'm an Asian? I can't help but think that way. Other people who walked in got seated first. I went to the counter and told them I was waiting the whole time (IN THE STORE, NOT OUTSIDE) and the worker said she didnt see me. Excuse me I was in front of those people you just seated and even got ordered from.

They thought I didn't speak any English or something and asked me to say beef tartare three times. I had to say the wine label two times. My pronunciation was very clear and extremely fluent.

Lastly they charged for still water (not bottled) for 25 dkk. Is this normal? Am I getting this because I'm a tourist?"

Excluding geranium that was the best restaurant we went to in Copenhagen and that says a lot!
They actually bake you fresh bread every 7-14 minutes, the dishes are beautiful and as per my experience worthy of high marks, the treatment is pleasant and... It's not expensive! Hell... I might even call it cheap!
Highly recommended!"

The menu is small but I prefer this in a cafe/restaurant as often I find it means the quality of the food is higher. I had the ratatouille and it was delicious. The stew was nicely seasoned and the fresh bread that accompanied the dish was excellent. The staff were very friendly and the price reasonable. Be aware that there is no toilet available for customers to use but this is not unusual with such a small business. Overall I highly recommend Mum's Deli and will definitely be back if I visit Copenhagen again.

The highlight of the meal was probably the french fries that were cooked in animal fat, so they were so aromatic and crispy. The worst part of the meal, however, was the rib eye. After waiting for so long, it was so chewy that my brother had to send it back. The waiter was less than understanding, and spoke to us as if we have never had steak before (e.g. ""are you aware that it is a fatty meat?"" and ""this is rib eye, it's supposed to be like this"").

We didn't feel like a 4 course meal, so we opted for just starting with some charcuterie, and then deciding on a 2nd course later. They were lenient on this, and even reacted quickly to our while-eating-charcuterie request of getting a sidedish for the current meal. This showcases their philosophy of wine first, food 2nd - in that the food wasn't second rate, but adaptable to the situation of the guests. In fact, the focus on well-sourced ingredients, presented plainly but with great taste and wine combinations, provided possibly one of the best dining experiences of my life. 5 stars aren't enough, they deserve more.

Food came out quickly. Noodles were fresh and meal tasted balanced, sauce was creamy. I liked the chicken which was soft and well cooked. Portion was on the bigger side, which is great if you can't finish your meal. We tried Chang beer. Service was quick and pleasant. I think they could have a bit bigger selection on Asian beers. Out of 2 only 1 was available. And food was on the pricer side- 135-200DKK per person and it was not so much different from other Asian food restaurants we tried.

I have ordered the ""M√•ltider med 1400 KCAL i 5 dage"" food package on Monday, April 22, 2019. My food never arrived and I didn't receive any notification with an explanation, so I wrote them on Thursday, May 02, 2019 explaining that I never received the food and asked for my money back. I didn't get a response but later on the same day (at 23:18 to be more precise), I got a message explaining that the food was delayed and if I wanted a refund I needed to write them back.

So, I replied to that email asking for a refund on May 03. No response. On May 12, I wrote again. No response. Then I called them on the week of May 13. They told me that they were working on it and that he had my email opened and that finance would contact me right away to send me a refund and a discount code if I wanted to order again in the future. It's been one week and I still have not heard from them with my refund. I tried calling them again today but nobody answered.

It's been more than a month since I ordered the meal package with them and still no meal nor refund. This is a complete scam!!! I feel completely ripped off."

Update: after my review, it has been recommended to remove it by the company, and has been promised redress and improvement many times, but nothing happens.

As an Italian living abroad I got used to avoiding Italian restaurants as they would rarely offer an experience close to authentic Italian cuisine. Well, this place is different. This is true Italian food, prepared to perfection and using prime ingredients. If this place was in Italy, it would be a top notch restaurant. The wine selection is excellent, and the staff is welcoming, careful and polite. The staff and the chef also made every effort to treat our 1-year old daughter. Thank you for the lovely evening, we will definitely be back again when in Copenhagen."

Some dishes were simply not anything special, but still good, and the fish dish was extremely salty and a bit too overcooked. For the price they charge the quality should have been better, same as the service. It took a long time until orders were taken and in general the service felt a bit sloppy and ad-hoc (but they were always very nice and friendly). I will not be visiting again nor will I be recommending anyone to go, there are other restaurants that are cheaper and better in Copenhagen."

Great care is taken to choose the best and healthiest ingredients to not only make the experience a tasty one but also a healthy choice. Having spent 5 years growing up in India I have a very developed and experienced taste for this culture of food, it is quite simply my favorite. I must say I was impressed with the restaurant and the owner's attention to detail and demand for the highest level of quality in every aspect.

The service was excellent, our waiter was nice, always smiling to the customers. He handled by himself the whole service ( roughly 40-45 customers), taking orders, serving, cleaning tables... There was not waiting time.
The food was also a very good surprise. The quantity did not compromise the quality of the dishes. It was also quite cheap, we paid around 1800kr for 5 people, including 2-3 courses per ppl and bottles of wine. So all in all, a very good experience, and I would definitely recommend if you wish to try traditional Danish food !"

We were asked to order beforehand everything (starters, main dishes, desserts, even drinks) & we were told that if a person doesn't come we'll have to pay 400 dkk (which could even be higher than what that person had ordered lol).

Good things:
- The environment/place is pretty nice
- The desserts were great
- Espresso Martini was good
- Prices  were ok per se (main courses weren't that tasty though)
-> 1 course is 150 dkk, 2 courses 225, 3 courses 250 ((note that that's per person and you can't choose multiple main dishes, you can just add starters & desserts))

We were disappointed with:
- Even though we pre ordered everything there still a TON of mistakes ( eg. they forgot a main dish, so a person had to wait more than 10 extra minutes to receive their main course)
- It was close to impossible to find a waiter / waitress to order additional drinks
- We had to remind them for the same drink several times until they actually brought it
- 3 people of us had pork for the main dish and we all find that the meat had a ton of extra fat - we couldn't eat more than half of it (see photo üòÖ)
- Lemonade costed 40 dkk and it wasn't even good

We wouldn't choose it again.

The som tam (papaya salad) was bland and not spicy at all and the other dishes were also lacking in both spice and just flavor in general. It's like they just assume that no Danish people can eat any kind of spicy food at all so they just serve up a bland, watered down version. It would be nice if they at least asked when ordering if you would like real Thai food or if you want the flavorless Danish version. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out they charge way too much for a glass of tap water."

Everything was effortlessly prepared.

First of all, the delivery was half and hour late after the estimated delivery time. Now, bear in mind this is almost 2 hours after the time the food had been ordered, and the restaurant is 2km away.

Secondly, the food was cold upon arrival, with several of the containers leaking into the bag. So much so, that when it arrived the poor delivery guy had to carry everything stacked together in the tattered remains of what used to be a paper bag.

The order was placed through just-eat, through whom we communicated with a customer service rep. The rep in turn spoke to the restaurant, who basically said there was nothing they could do about it, but offer us a 10% discount.

If this had been in the restaurant, at least I could have got up and walked out, instead of having to wait 2 hours for cold food, at full price. Whether or not they had issues on there end is no responsibility of the paying customer, and the least they could have done is reach out to apologise for the delay.

Don't waste your time."

Reply to Nordic Noodle:

We order the food online on your website and are told that there is a 30 min waiting time. Which we accept. We come to pick up the food and the chef has not started cooking yet. We get the mentioned soda, as compensation. Which was totally ok. Where the movie cracks and I scold is after the chef spills some of our food onto the very dirty stove and throws it in the wok again. As I say to your cashier, it's simply too disgusting and I will not pay for it. I'm asking for my money back. Cashiers agree with me that he would not eat food that has been in contact with the dirty stove either. A new portion is made and I go.

I have added a picture of the stove after it was dried off once. Sorry, but it's simply too unhygienic."

Basically, you get a tablet and can order as much as you want and as many times as you want. Drinks are extra.

Sushi is pretty good, and there's a nice variety of alternative dishes as well.

We tried the Diavola, which costs 110 DKK and it was probably the best Diavola pizza we've ever tried.
We also had the Quattro Formaggi, which costs 135 DKK, and it was pretty decent - just not the best we've had.

The size of the pizza is pretty good, they are pretty large.

Sodas are kind of expensive, a small coke (330 ml) was 30 DKK.

We would definitely visit it again :)"

When I asked what kind of beer they had, I got a flabby answer that I could see it in the menu myself, instead of being polite and service-minded and telling me so. The pizzas were just as disappointing and not least boring. They were small and one was half-burnt and the bottoms paper thin. Very stingy with cheese and was pretty much only made from tomato sauce. I think it is definitely naughty to take 80 kr for a pizza of such a low standard. At those prices, service and food just have to be in order.

This a perfect hidden burger joint gem, near Islands Brygge Metro. You order through a hole in the wall, due to the construction work it is a bit difficult to find. You can sit out site in the court, and there is no rain cover, so I  case of bad weather, take away would be a good idea.
You are greeted by a amazing smell oozing out from the kitchen.
Staff was friendly, welcoming and very busy. I ordered Cheese Burger Bacon combo, and it was perfect. The bun was delicious and both salad and red onions was fresh and  the beef was perfectly cooked. The entire burger was in my opinion perfectly balanced and an explosion of taste.

9199,ChIJXdbkpBdTUkYRO6NpiMExk-w,Per Karsten Stolle,en,5,1634122609,"Dinner at Kong Hans was a very enjoyable evening from start to end!

I can warmly recommend the wine paring to compliment the food - they have done an excellent job, to 'upgrade' the experience!

The set menu for the evening, took us through a suite of meats: shellfish, fish, poultry and game meat, all nicely prepared.

Only two things to point out:

- The first serving of appetizers went a bit too fast as we had no wine served to match the food. In my view the drinks needs to be served first, before any dishes are served.

- The other point is when a dish is described with ingredients highlighted, then I expect you are able to taste them. Example we had a starter dish with apricot, but the taste didn't really surface. Probably because the dish was too small or maybe a different serving temperature would have allowed the taste of apricot to kick in.

Rating 5 √ó stars+!"

The only reason it's not 5 star place in my opinion is the fact that you have to pick side dishes to the main menu. I don't understand why restaurants exclude all kinds of vegetables and make you choose between salads and potatoes unless you pay more.
But anyway I will probably comeback and drink a peachfuzz again."

9251,ChIJAyIIxRlTUkYRxa8kQMVeHUE,Stefan Cosmin Cioroiu,en,1,1618668983,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while now, so this happened like a year ago. It's not about the food or the service of the restaurant itself, but rather about the attitude of the employees.

My girlfriend and I were biking one day around town and decided to stop and walk into a place close to this restaurant. Because we couldn't notice any place to leave my girlfriend's bike, we leaned it next to a wall, close to the restaurant, which by the way, looked as if it was closed from outside.

We were back 10 min later to find my girlfriend's bike moved, not a little bit away from the restaurant's wall, but in the middle of the street, where cars had to literally go around it.

I went inside and nicely asked the 2 employees there if they were the ones who moved the bike. They could've chosen to reply nicely, but instead they threw an aggressive ""YEAH, WE DID"" at me, sounding as if almost adding a ""SO WHAT?!"" to it. I then told them that it wasn‚Äôt very nice and that they could've at least move it closer to the sidewalk. They decided to explain to me with the same aggressive tone that it was only our fault to leave it there in the first place.

Just for disclosure, we couldn't see any available bike stands nearby and it is a very common thing in Copenhagen to leave bikes around like that, especially if only for a couple of minutes.

Anyways, I just left there with a bitter taste, wondering if it's the same way that they talk to their customers... ridiculous."

Food has been excellent with a 3-course menu for a bit more than 300dkk. Nice collection of wine at affordable rate too. Tunisia and France are working together in the main room to make your stay a pleasant moment.
9342,ChIJrfWDFeJSUkYRXGR4qWPUs0U,Sheldon Scott,en,5,1504808372,"Oh my word. How can I begin to describe the amazing flavours I experienced here.

I started with the ""Signature dish"" the cheese souffle. A must is all I can say. I dont have the culinary words to describe it and do it justice.

Mains, Beef tenderloin medium rare on a pureed cauliflower blend, oven roasted white beetroot and mushrooms and a side of baby potatoes. Oh and a gravy to die for. Just a perfect blend of flavour.

Desert was a chocolate fondant on a slightly burnt caramel sauce with vanilla ice cream. What a way to finish a dinner.

Actually, that was two nights ago. I am back again for all the same. Try it, you wont be disappointed. I get nothing for writing this review, just want you to experience it too."

But I think there is far from a heated pizza to a gourmet pizza that it launches as. Because that's what it is - mold-baked pizzas that are cooked to order. The taste range is large, simple but not very varied. My experience was that the pizza was dry and several were almost impossible to bite off. But of course the place had to be tested and the intro price fits OK with the experience. Unfortunately, I will definitely choose another place next time I get pizza hungry."
9370,ChIJx2r8QONSUkYRQTJp4FPIoes,Giorgio Malvermi,en,1,1629638337,"My most horrible food experience to date.

Vietnamese food is renowned worldwide for its freshness and savour, an ingenious mix of sweet and salty ingredients, a cornucopia of flavours for your tastebuds. You cannot imagine the sheer horror in receiving the food cooked in this ""restaurant"", ordered during a very unfortunate Oriental food crave. The Pho was tasteless, an insipid mix of cheap meat and noodles sinking at the bottom of what I can only describe as the worst broth to have ever existed, a metaphoric Pho-ck you to my customer experience. The chicken wings coming as a side, supposedly marinated in honey, tasted of garlic and were dry (how this is possible is unbeknownst to me and my girlfriend). To this day, I mourn the loss of our winged friends, who sacrificed their short lives for such an unremarkable culinary achievement. Last but not least, the ""Rice Noodles with Pork Meat and Spring Roll"". In this lame attempt to combine Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine, a DIY main course more akin to an Ikea piece of furniture than to actual food,  the chef clearly forgot to add any spice, or flavour, or passion.

If you are the owner of this restaurant, I am deeply sorry if you're finding youself in a job you're clearly not qualified, nor talented for. I wish you the best of luck in your future career."

But this review is more about the quality of the food. For 120-150kr you can get a basic menu with fries and a drink. Which isn't anything shocking, especially if you're next to the lakes.

The burger itself leaves you wondering why you didn't go to McDonalds to save 60kr for nearly the exact same quality of a burger.

I had a YoBacon Menu, and my mate had a YoChicken Menu, and they both tasted like they were fresh out of the microwave.

The fries looked and tasted like those 1kg of frozen fries you get from Netto for 10kr, which wouldn't bother me if they spent more time on making them more unique. I understand that it's a business afterall."

Friendly and helpfull staff and very good helpful waiters.
We Got everything with good timing and got the correct orders.
To be honest the starters Were nothing special and very ordinary.
Chicken satay was too dry and tuff for my taste. Marinating it for 24-48 hours to make it more juicy and using a better quality chicken would make it much better. Satay sauce was nice with a hint of lemon grass.
spring roll very ordinary and a little dry. Putting raw minced meat with the vegetables and glass nOodles would make them better. Adding sesame oil or White pepper could also make them better (with risk of tasting Chinese though) or adding coriander or spring onion would also be nice.
The corn in those tartelet looking items was a little corny. üòõ.
All main courses were just very tasteful and delicious. All meats were soft and juicy and sauces well balanced in all tastes and flavors. We had seared spicy lamb, green curry beef, som tam and caramelized duck. Clearly the meat quality was much better than many other Thai places. Accompanied by steamed rice and sticky rice. All recommendable and all matching the chosen wine very well. We drank the chateau roc st. Michel st. Emilion grand gru 2014 and it was surprisingly well paired with the main courses especially with the sweet Thai basil.
A little pricy compared to other Thai restaurants but worth it.
The starters are the only reason I am not giving 5 stars."

Thank you for the great service and wines! We really enjoyed your drinks and the restaurant vibe. The waiters were very friendly and really knew about the dishes. Very cozy!

HOWEVER, the vegetarian menu was very disappointing. It was lacking that punch and personality from the Latin cuisine. The grilled padrones were extremely spicy! I usually love spicy food, but this was uneatable and the cauliflower was undercooked and unseasoned.

My impression is that this vegetarian menu was created for that 'one person' that can't eat meat. Thus, little effort and passion are placed on the ingredients, and is absolutely not worth the price at all!

The grounds are very lovely and tranquil, and just across the street from Lake Geneva. Very convenient to the lake walk and attractions in this part of town. Also very convenient to metro stop which can take you everywhere you would like to go in the city. The views of the Alps across the lake are stunning and relaxing. Magnificent sunrise, and if you travel a few blocks east same can be said for sunset."

Why I‚Äôve given it three stars isn‚Äôt because the place was bad but rather what you get for your money. The prices are quite high for Copenhagen. It takes a while to get the courses or any kind of attention from the staff. And finally, the portions are rather small and don‚Äôt taste as fresh as you find at some Thai places.

But the staff are nice, the food tastes good and the dishes are unique interpretations of Thai ideas.

If I could give 3.5 stars I would but given the prices and attentiveness, I‚Äôve rounded down."

The waiters where running in the restaurant (not exactly being calm and showing control), they forgot to give bread, when it came they had forgot to bring butter which took 3 times to ask for before it came, they didn't refill our wine glasses when empty, we had to ask for more water typically 2-3 times everytime to get it.
Previous experiences have been good, but I guess no more."

Even a very light eater should not be afraid to order the 7 course menu. You will be fine!
Next time, I will not be ordering their wine menu as not a lot of their choices were to my taste. The ala carte wine does offer some great wine, and they have plenty of interesting drinks. Hopefully, I won't get a wobbly table again."

However, most dishes were quite heavy (missing some ligher components  to balance it) and some of them more interesting rather than delicious in a way that would make you wish for more.
Unfortunately, in the end, this dinner gave me such a bad stomach that I spent the rest of the night at home in the bathroom, until my body had nothing left in it.
After politely contacting the restaurant about it, I got no reply at all, which really disappointed me. It seems arrogant and unprofessional given that it strives to be a classy Michelin-plate place, with a hefty price tag to match it.
All in all, will certainly never return there. Not worth the price."

9712,ChIJbRtt6hhTUkYRFpXK5nRGSbI,Carlos LS,en,2,1615830645,"Not really Mexican cuisine. It tries to brand itself as authentic Mexican, but actually it would be like Tex-Mex. So a lot of truly Mexican flavours are just not there (variety of chilies, nixtamalized corn, pumpkin seed, green tomato, nopal, annatto, epazote, any kind of mole, etc.). Expectations aside, not terrible but not remarkable taste, quite plain.

This reminds me of the kind of Mexican restaurants before Mexican foods were available in Europe, so they had to imitate the style somehow. Regrettably this one has remained like that (or leaned towards the Tex-Mex) even when proper ingredients and recipes are accessible.

Edited: To answer to the zealous owner below, I was there in November 2020 while it was open and I don't own any business whatsoever. Terrible attitude from the owner throwing accusations around."

9718,ChIJ76FQqBlTUkYR-JrCeC46X90,Bernard Henrissat,en,2,1631598984,"Two years ago we commended your restaurant for the excellent service and superb food.
Yesterday we took again the ""Perfect Day"" menu, but things were not like two years ago. Food was still good, but the table and seats were very dirty. Yet we had to insist that the table would be cleaned before our food would be served. At the prices practiced (this is a *very* expensive place) why not use paper table covers ? That would be so much more hygienic than the fake leather tables with sticky leftovers from thousands of previous customers. Then the service was not at all what you expect from a high end sushi restaurant. We ordered cocktails to start our evening: they arrived with no munchies (110 DKK per glass), but less than 5 min later our menu began arriving. Cocktails are drinks BEFORE a meal, not to drink along your food. Then the food kept on arriving too fast. When the warm sticks arrived we we still not finished with our sushis. When we were finished with our sushis, then our warm sticks ... were cold. My wife wanted some sweet soja sauce. It took forever to arrive. Having not been asked if we wanted a drink since our starting cocktails, we ordered a beer, which of course arrived after our meal was finished. A catastrophic service. Our waitress was wearing lots of tattoos but that does not make a good waitress (and is not very classy either).
Wake up Sticks and Sushis: select and train your staff, use new paper table covers for each new customer, serve cocktails with a few little munchies, bring new dishes when customers are finished with their previous ones, etc, and you will go to the top again."

The dishes were a bit hit and miss, the steak was amazing but the deserts were poor. Also 2 of the dishes being quite unimaginative pasta is a bit of a poor show.

The waitress we had was potentially the best service I've ever had.

We stayed after the food for a drink where the restaurant turns into a kind of bar extension on Gothersgade, which was kind of fun but not what we expected or would've chosen."

I'm deeply disappointed about the service. When you go to a restaurant,  you want to have a good time and enjoy the moment, it's a mutual trust you put in for the restaurant. I certainly do not expect the restaurant to make an irresponsible mistake which ends my vegetarianism for no good reason."

The snacks in the beginning were mostly good, The main dishes were ok (not wow), The deserts were not tasty at all (I went to 7-eleven after to get something tasty for myself). The service was very slow. The entire meal was 4 and a half hours. Not good enough for a Michelin in my opinion."

The first person explained that we were not in the reservation book and went to get a manager. A second person came and also explained that in fact we were not in the reservation book. A third person came over and said, ‚Äúno problem, follow me this way‚Äù (I believe his name was Matthias).
He was very welcoming and seated us straight away.
17 presentations and a few were stand outs. Including: caviar course (which is an additional charge), brioche bread with lemon cream cheese, finger food salad with tarragon and mint, the sauce from the zucchini flower (mushroom sauce).
There were some equal items that were underwhelming and problematic. I have notes on those as well.
Overall for the price we were still hungry when we left and left wondering why the price didn‚Äôt meet the expectation.
We were wondering why, for that price, we were seated next to the water closet (maybe because of the reservation that never got written into the book??).
Ali was a great waiter and very personable. Thom was also very attentive. Excellent staff and made our night enjoyable."

Everything was perfect, and I must say thank you to Sammy for being able to squeeze us in even though we made the reservation quite late.
On the night, Cod and the team made us feel like royalty.  All the staff had an energy and enthusiasm that told us they really love what they are doing.  There was a sense of ""fun"" that I never expected in a Michelin stared restaurant.
The food was exquisite, and we were constantly waiting to see how the next dish would surprise us, and we were never disappointed.
At the end of the night, Cod presented us with a card signed by all the staff wishing us well for the future, my new wife almost cried!

Usually I never write reviews, but I have the last 3 times where I have ordered sandwich got toasted sandwich bread. However, they have made an order after I showed how black-roasted my sandwich bread has been, but it's just a waste of time to wait for the staff to make a sandwich again.

Today I happily agreed to order with my boyfriend and was greeted by a very dismissive and arrogant employee. I come in and say hello in a friendly way and stand up to the counter to order, he is in the process of making a juice - it must be said that there are no other customers or staff in the store, only him / the employee, my boyfriend and I. I kindly say hello again and look at him, he just looks blankly back at me without answering, smiling or giving any kind of welcome. He was not wearing a face mask so I could see all his face expressions and see if he moved his mouth to say something, but he did not. He has both his airpods in his ears and completely rejects my 2 greetings and my boyfriend and my presence. I work in a shop myself and it is MEGA bad service that he does not say ""hello"" when he sees 2 customers come in and line up at the counter (when there are not even any other customers!), It is mega bad service that can not say ""hello"" after the customer has said it twice to him and mega bad service that he can not just say ""just a moment, I just have to finish this, then I have to be there"", instead of not react and just look blankly at me / the customer several times as if it was a nuisance that a customer came.

Being an Indian, I would never ever recommend this restaurant. This is an anti-Indian restaurant and does not even know what an Indian food/snacks is. Such a horrendous place.

Reply to your response: if you can‚Äôt offer anything from the menu then do not bother to hand over the menu card to the customers. We ordered a simple Indian snacks from the menu and if you can‚Äôt offer that then there is no point in calling it as Indian restaurant. Besides, train your staff to be courteous to the customers and not physically abuse them. Also I would like you to get your facts cleared with your staff and would suggest to look at the recording in the camera of your restaurant where you will know that we don‚Äôt have a hobby of yelling infact your staff member at the counter yelled passing insane comments of not having us enough knowledge when and where to wear scarfs, also he literally pushed me and wife out of the restaurant. Let me tell you it was the incredible Indian culture only who saved your staff insane person on the counter else he would have been behind the bars by now.

Only recommendation i can make is, me and my colleague ordered egg fried rice and it served in one plate as large portion. It was ok at this instance as I knew the colleague well. But better to serve 2 people seperately, as it could be awkward if 2 people dont know each other well to share from one dish. Quality of the chicken was ok but, as they pulled off the bone from different pieces the texture was not uniform through out the dish. May be using only chicken breast or leg meat be ideal.

Keep up the good service."

The brunch menu was good but you only get to experience a sweet flavoring on both dishes and since brunch it‚Äôs supposed to be a mix between breakfast and lunch we missed the contrast of sweet and salty which left us feeling a little bit too high on sugar. So next time the brunch could be shared as a big dessert instead.
And about the 3 course menu, it was almost perfect except for the dessert that was very flat. The first 2 dishes were an excellent mixed of flavors, very tasty and delicious.
We will definitely come back but chose better what to try.

I had the wienerschnitzel that was the special of the day, and it was probably the best one I've ever had, complete with anchovies and capers as well as a sublime sauce. So juicy and tender. The Hummer Bisque as a starter was great too. The only disappointment was the dessert, rhubarb crumble ice cream with a jelly bottom. The jelly was weird and dominated the consistency.

A little on the expensive side but service was impeccable with wine and water glasses being refilled automatically by observant waiters/waitresses.

Highly recommended."

And I suggest you to try their homemade lemonade. It's great."

Definitely one of the best pitas I have had till now (and I have had many a pita in my time on earth) Definitely worth visiting multiple times. The quality of ingredients, the taste, the freshness, all are excellent. If I could give the place 6 stars, I would."

I got my beef pita and was amazed by the amount of that meet in the pita and the flavor! Just amazing, every bite was a thrill to enjoy all over again...

And then come the fries, perfectly crunchy but soft inside with just perfect seasoning, not only salt but extra herbs gave them another depth that matched my pita so perfectly...

When you think that your experience is full now, think again! Take that delicious lemonade as drink and get surprised, yet another ""ohh"" to add... And then you are happy, really happy.

Very easy 5 star review, it is just a perfect, delicious experience."

We had several dishes and just to give you an idea of how bad it was.
The chicken vindaloo: the chicken wasn't cooked with the sauce, the taste was very off, there were probably 4 pieces of chicken in the portion, the sauces were sweet, we wondered if they mix it with jam (awful and yes it was that bad!).
We ordered some naan bread with the food, it was thick and no taste whatsoever, I tell you, the naan ready made in the supermarket is nicer than what this restaurant serves.

The service was amazing. The waitress was super friendly! Her wine recommendations were on point and provided clear information on what we were eating with every single dish. The starters and mains were decently spaced out, allowing us time to really just enjoy the company and experience.

The food was top. Everything was well prepared, juicy and full of flavor! If you find yourself here, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you don't order a steak! Cooked how you like it, cooked the way it should. I will keep coming back to this one!"

10103,ChIJUWPJEj1TUkYRqeE2AOCjSbw,Flemming Skjold Iversen,en,4,1624698569,"I wanted to give this place a five stars - the food and service certainly warrants a top rating as this is one of the best steak places I have been to in Copenhagen. We had all the ""real starters"" (ie. no salad) and the steak, all top notch and the steak was cooked for each of us just as ordered. The wine pairing was spot on for each course and interesting enough to be a topic of conversation at the table.

If you are a walk-in, and love steak, I highly recommend this place.

Which brings us to the reason for the missing star. We booked one of the dining rooms for our party and to be honest, the communcation was a mess of half answered emails, where I was not really certain that we had agreed on a menu for the table. Or on when we should arrive as the automated booking system kept sending reminders for a different time than I had booked the room (I later found out that this was the time they had reserved the room internally)

When booking the room I was told that if we ordered the same menu for the entire table, we would get a reduced price - despite repeated requests for confirmation of the menu and what the price would be, I got no information on these two points. And when I called an hour before the dinner to sort this out a slightly confused person at the other end told me that the discount would be a welcome cocktail.

As I said, I really wanted to give this restaurant five stars. And I am thrilled to see that my guests at the dinner, who was spared the initial communication mess, have given it a well deserved top rating for the dining experience alone.

I will definitely return. But I probably wont order ahead next time."

To avoid further waiting we went in to pay the bill, I understand there is jazz concert going on and it's probably busy in the kitchen, still nobody seem to care enough to help us get the bill and when we finally got it, it was the wrong bill twice! We had 2 glasses of wine, but they mistakenly asked as to pay the price of 2 bottles first, then change to another wrong bill for 2 glasses of a more expensive wine.
What's even worse and the most unacceptable was, not any apologies or showing minimum friendliness, when we tried to explain the mistake, the lady was giving us the look of distrust and just trying to get rid of us.
Didn't try the food but the worst service I've experienced after living in Copenhagen for 5 years."

Unfortunately it has been always a bit disappointing here and there. The first time they didn't offer the special fork for picking out the crab claw meat, nor a cracker. This time they did so, but the lobster was served between cooked-fresh, which makes it really confusing to eat in room temperature. The oysters were also a bit abnormally served directly with pickled onion on them, without letting you to choose how to have them. I wouldn't want to have the doubt but maybe the oysters were not thst fresh in the beginning. The scallops were a bit unfresh also, but the shrimps were good. Plus, i ordered a glass of Chardonnay, they just brought one and overly filled in my glass without letting me to taste first.. Might be just a small flaw the waiter made, but please allow me to just mention it here because he could have been more professional :)
In general, if you want seafood plate, there are definitely better places in town. I havent tried other dishes from Almanak, the fact they have decafe espresso impressed me, so after all i am not that negative about this place. Please take other reviews into account regarding the other aspects."

After asking for it a few times and then straigt up complaining after almost an hour, they found the food and promised us a discount. The food was pretty good, but not worth the wait. We got a 10%  discount, which is honestly ridiculous (why even bother with a discount then?), I couldn't be bothered spending more time or getting my blood pressure up, so we just accepted it, paid and left.

I ordered to fried pork, I got dried up, few days old pork slices that have been chucked in the deep fryer. So tough, stiff and dry and tasteless. You couldn't use utensils on it due to how hard it was, had to eat with your fingers. My partners food was fine, but a good 10 cm of the edge of his plate was broken off."

When we finally got our food, i noticed the edge on my plate was missing, and its not like small pieces, literally big chunks. My food was not awful, but not grate for the price i paid, i would say it was around 5/10.  My girlfriends food was awful, old, dry, overdone fried pork. Would not recommend this place."

The food isn't very fresh, not even close to real Italian food, and the calamari look like fried onion rings. We asked for pasta without peppers and the waiter said it's okay, but later we got pasta with peppers.

10203,ChIJ7WS1tiJTUkYRUjzjyOQTbdc,Jaikishore Sharma,en,5,1626718707,"The best thing about Nyhavn Pizzeria is easy to pen: it is barely 20 feet into the Lille Strandstraede that veers right from Nyhavn at the Restaurant Skagen and yet is so inconspicuous as to barely be there. This helps on a day when every other eatery / pub / pattiserie on Nyhavn is extremely crowded and one is in no mood to venture any further to find food.

The place is below the level of the street and is accessed by a narrow, descending flight of stairs. We were here on a bitingly cold December afternoon and went in as much for succour from the cold as for anything else. Once inside, the interiors register as a piece of Italy yoked across the breadth of Europe and planted in Copenhagen. The smells of the bread and the seasoning are unmistakable. There were no waiters / waitresses when we were here. Indeed, the place is a one man show. That means orders can be a while coming (ours was close to 40 minutes) but if this isn't an issue, then Nyhavn Pizzeria is for you.

The pizzeria had two vegetarian pizzas (expressly stated as such in the menu) and we had the Veggie Love Pizza (size - small): Spinach, Olives, Potatoes and Rosemary (asked for no mushrooms). The portion is more than good enough for 2 if either party isn't starved and it cost 75 Kr. It tasted good but I've had better. On the side, we had crisp and meaty Pomme Frites for 34 Kr. For roughly 110 Kr, two of us had managed to fill our palates. At approx. 15 Eur, that works out to be amazingly cheap by European standards and constitute a veritable steal in costly Copenhagen and Denmark.

Overall, this isn't a place anyone would go to for a gourmet experience or a particularly engaging experience with taste buds but it represents that rare thing: convenience of location, low prices and good food."
10204,ChIJ7WS1tiJTUkYRUjzjyOQTbdc,Ali Saber,en,5,1608109447,"I liked the pizza, it was special and I liked the cleanliness, and it is a very beautiful historical place."
10205,ChIJMTnLSz1TUkYRzObbjnQjtKI,Aleksandra Samsonova,en,3,1632484742,"I invited my friend for a brunch to this place today, as the website & the pictures looked great; the restaurant is centrally placed.

My friend arrived earlier and greeted the waiter in English, but got the Danish menu anyways. As we were waiting for the food, we quickly realised that the average customer is 65+ üòÉ The food was okay, but a few plates had little cracks.

There were 2 waiters: a younger girl was very friendly and service-minded, while the older one couldn't care less... We didn't feel welcome. She served us the food and brought the receipt with a real bitter expression on her face. In between we didn't see her. Meanwhile, the friendly one offered more bread, offered more water, took the empty plates and made us feel good ‚ù§

I work myself in the service industry, so I know how hard it can be to pull yourself together on a bad day, but I keep the focus on the job I love. I wish people didn't have to do the jobs they don't like. I expected a little bit more from a restaurant at Nyhavn."

Fwiw, before eating here, I would flat out answer ‚ÄúNo‚Äù if you asked me if I liked traditional Danish food. What can I say? Pickled herring never ‚Äúcaught‚Äù on for meüòÜ However, my husband and I had been meaning to try Restaurant Gilleleje ever since we moved right by it. Finally last Sunday we did, and it for real gave me a complete paradigm shift (yes, I did just say that) on how I feel about Danish food.

I‚Äôm pretty sure I ate my bodyweight in sm√∏rrebr√∏d that day, let alone the other consumptions, and I do not regret it one bit(e).

If you leave being hungry, you have a problem. But it is not quantity over quality. The food, including the delicious bread, is extremely tasty, homemade and organic. You can tell by the roasted pork and the sausage (medister). That the chef is a pro. I can't go through the entire list of food. But I will also mention the salmon which melts on your tongue, served with (organic) in scrambled eggs made with double cream. The list of ""snaps"" (famous strong Scandinavian liquor) is comprehensive.

The Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) are the best part of the experience, well made and tasty. Vietnamese beer is available as well.
Interior is nice but stools are uncomfortable. Maybe on purpose so people won't hang around for too long?

I had a few bites, paid and left. It was so bad, I couldn‚Äôt even finish it.

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúViet Nam Restaurant‚Äù but it‚Äôs owned by a Chinese family - I speak Mandarin and can understand their conversations. The interior decor is also Chinese - not Vietnamese.

When you enter the store there is menu on Danish, but instantly when waiter saw us staring into menu surprised he call us and offer us to show us menu on English.

Very welcoming staff, friendly and professional.

Food was extremely delicious, I had noodles with chicken and my wife had fried rice with chicken.

My noodles were absolutely amazing, I love to eat Asian food but this time it was absolutely amazing. Tenderness and softness of noodles were top class,something you would expect to be charged much more then what dish was here. Super affordable and honestly amazing, amazing food. My best noodles dish so far!

Highly recommend when you come to visit this part of Copenhagen to sit here and have lunch or dinner, you won't regret.

The waiter we went to weren't willing to listen to us and seem not to know what we were talking about. Finally a waitress knew and just showed us with hand where we should go. The table and the chairs were in a small corner and shaking due to the pavers (uncomfortable). Just gave us food menu but not even the drink choices. Seemed to be bothered every time she talked to us. Didnt ask for the baking of the meat.

And finally went to us for the bill, what a surprise to pay 320DKK (43‚Ç¨) SIMPLY for a steak with fries and a coke LOL!  That's the price of a good restaurant with flawless service.
And it just ended the same way, as the waitress then left us didn't even say goodbye after we paid.

I am celebrating the 15th birthday of my daughter with 40 diners in the garden,
Frank from Joe's Diner had put together a buffet that was beautifully, simply and uncomplicatedly stuffed with good taste and refinement, my meeting with Joe's Diner exceeded all expectations and I can highly recommend the place. When you think about the fine ingredients and the love that could easily be felt was added to the food, price was certainly also more fair and reasonable.

Another thing it was also possible to order wine (again with passion for what can be squeezed out of the golden drops) at Joe's Diner through their wine shop or of course just by talking to Joe's diner, in my case they found both a white and red wine that fit perfectly with the buffet and the buget.

Thanks for this time, it will not be the last.

Det meste af maden var ganske l√¶kkert. Dog havde laksen st√•et for l√¶nge og var helt udt√∏rret, den flappede n√¶rmest opad. Liges√• med skinken.
Det tager alt af ""l√¶kker"" effekten.
Hovedretten var fin.
Desserten, der var t√¶rtebunden, som om den ikke var blevet bagt. Ikke l√¶kkert! Isen derimod var vild l√¶kker.
√Ürgerligt, at man selv skal g√∏re opm√¶rksom p√• at man mgl den n√¶ste vin til hovedretten, n√•r der er bestilt vin menu.
Derudover, blev jeg godt utilfreds med at der ikke oplyses om at man ""kun"" kan f√• 1 flaske vand med. Vi bestilte 1 med brus og 1 uden brus. Hvortil der bliver spurgt. Vil I have 2 flasker? Vi svarer ""ja"" (og t√¶nker, at det er lidt sv√¶rt, at servere med og uden i samme flaske)
Da vi s√• er f√¶rdige f√•r vi at vide, at man kun f√•r 1 gratis flaske vand med en vin menu.
Jeg forst√•r ikke, hvorfor man ikke g√∏r os opm√¶rksom p√• dette ved bestillingen. Det kan umuligt koste restauranten en formue, bare at give ad libitum vand, n√•r man har k√∏bt vin menuen.
Det dummeste er s√•, at jeg f√•r at vide, at der st√•r p√• dining weeks hjemmesiden, at man kan f√• 1 glas vand, men de v√¶lger at give 1 flaske.
Det er decideret l√∏gn, der st√•r intet om vand p√• dining weeks hjemmeside.
Det er ikke fordi jeg ikke vil betale for vand, jeg synes bare, at man b√∏r oplyse om prisen. Jeg t√¶nker, at den er inkluderet, n√•r jeg allerede har bestilt vin.
Derudover kan jeg m√•ske ogs√• forst√• det, hvis vi havde efterladt det meste, men det var ikke tilf√¶ldet.
Generelt var betjeningen lang under middel. Og det er √¶rgerligt!
Ved pr√¶sentationen af retterne, var det meget sparsomt med info og endnu mindre ved de forskellige glas vin, trods vi spurgte lidt ind til dem.

Derfor giver jeg kun 2 stjerne til dette sted.

P.S. Jeres valg af d√¶kservietter med reklamer for jeres steder og en konkurrence mellem alle anmeldelser p√• Trustpilot eller Google (det bliver bestemt ikke min, med den d√•rlige anmeldelse) s√• minder det en del om en billig k√¶derestaurant ala Jensen B√∏fhus. De er bare en hel del billigere!"

10549,ChIJmQ--ByFTUkYR_GcLc1VFAOU,Yue Yin,en,3,1573811844,"My friend was very cold and we happened to see this cafe. firstly, i thought it was where we could only have a cup of coffee, but it is a restaurant. there was no one waiting at the door, and because this is the first time for us to be in Denmark so the pace and rule of a restaurant we don't know precisely, but we were waiting for while, still no one served us, we thought maybe we should go to have a seat ourselves, and this is should be apologized. after that the boss told us that 's danish style we should wait at the door and someone will seat us, that's cool, because every country is like that.    the difference is just about the time you wait, longer or shorter, it depends on the social environment or efficiency of a country. anyways, we enjoyed the trip so much and had a lot of fun there though we didn't have lunch there because we just kept going to find a coffee shop. i believe it is a good restaurant and serves good meal.

10564,ChIJSY2mTedSUkYR6KCFTVINHaI,Lisa_ and_Christian,en,2,1570953597,"Frankly, we were disappointed. Not everything was bad, but the overall impression we were left with was sadly negative.

The good things:

The sommelier (tall blond guy) was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. He welcomed us warmly when we walked in the door. And when it came to choosing wine, he clearly had a good level of expertise.

The decor was beautiful‚Äîthe lighting, dark walls and layout.The dishes, cutlery, and glassware were polished and sparkling.

The food was presented beautifully.

The problems:

1. Unavailable wines. Before we went to the restaurant, we reviewed the wine list online and chose one in advance. When we arrived that particular wine was not on the menu. No problem. We chose another and ordered it. We were told they didn‚Äôt have it. So we made another choice and ordered that. They also didn‚Äôt have it. At this point, the sommelier made two suggestions and brought us the two to sample. We opted for another choice from the wine menu instead of his suggestions. Guess what? They didn‚Äôt have that either‚Äîbut he didn‚Äôt tell us. After a good long wait, he showed up at the table with a different one than we ordered and said it was an upgrade. (We really have no way of knowing whether it was or wasn‚Äôt.)

2. Extremely slow service. There only seemed to be two people waiting on the tables for a full restaurant (one of whom was the sommelier and the other was a girl who only seemed to be there to fill water.) After being seated, it was 25 mins before water was brought and then a verrrrry long time before any food came out and between the courses. When we finally got the wine, it was opened but we waited another 15 mins for him to bring a decanter and pour it.

3. The food itself. The pomme anna potatoes were very underdone‚Äîalmost crunchy and hard.The baby carrots were unpeeled. The dessert (lemon tart) had a crust that was so hard, we could hardly break it with our spoons. Additionally, the lemon curd was completely runny.

The biggest problems:

1. We didn‚Äôt get what we paid for. We booked this restaurant (and prepaid) weeks in advance as part of the ‚ÄòDinner Days‚Äô festival week. During Dinner Days, you book your reservation, place your food order in advance, and pre-pay (also in advance). We booked the 3 courses on offer but also added extras (oysters and foie gras). The oysters were delicious. However, when our main dish arrived the foie gras was not there. The waiter/sommelier didn‚Äôt mention it until we asked about it. He replied, ‚ÄúOh sorry, we‚Äôre out of foie gras. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm shaving some truffle over your dish as a replacement.‚Äù We weren‚Äôt thrilled, but what can you do? If they don‚Äôt have it, they don‚Äôt have it. And we didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss. However, the right thing to do would have been to address it on arrival.

We pre-paid for a dish they didn‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs not like we chose our menu on the spot. The most irritating thing is that they weren‚Äôt going to say anything until we mentioned it.

How many other people also paid for the foie gras and didn‚Äôt get it? They should not sell what they don‚Äôt have. And in the case of not having it, a refund should have been offered. At the very least, they could have offered a glass of champagne as a replacement.

2. We were brought water (non-bottled, just in pitchers) and asked if we wanted sparkling or flat. At no point were we told that water cost money. We were charged 40 kroner on our bill for the water.

Overall, it wasn‚Äôt a horrible evening. We were just very disappointed, felt a bit cheated to be honest, and would not go back or recommend it."

10618,ChIJhyTcmoJTUkYR6WSg0Li4NXA,Micha≈Ç Sendecki,en,2,1633954049,"I had been staying in Comwell Copenhagen Portside hotel over the weekend and experienced bad communication from the side of hotel stuff as well as lacking good quality of service.
I will point out couple of main issues and points which were on plus:

1. Parking at hotel is not belonging to hotel, but to some outer company. Guests needs to pay separately for parking in the hotel building in 4star hotel. Moreover there is no guarantee that there are free slots of parking in the same building. If not, You are asked to find parking slots at other place outside the building and of course as well cover expenses by yourself.

2. Breakfasts are, I would say, medium, like for 4 star hotel. Right, the furniture in the dining hall are pretty exclusive, however food itself is like nothing special. And most of dishes at one of breakfast time on Sunday was already eaten by 10am.

3. Daily cleaning and bedsheets changing was out of order without any notifying guests. I was pretty sure that cleaning during me being out of the room shall happen, however not. Room was exactly in the same condition. Moreover rubish bin was full of garbage. Our toilet papers were empty without getting new ones. That is not good for four-star hotel.

4. Setting temperature in the room was out of order as well. That was not possible to warm up the room in spite of getting thermostat set on the higher temperature. I got explanation from the stuff that heating in the room is not working when temperature is set for over 21 degrees, while it was possible to set it up to 24 degrees. I shall be informed about it in advance to be able to get at least those 21 degrees. But that is not the worse. As I got to know, hotel has issues with heating when there is full occupancy and even setting temperature up to 21 degrees doesn't helped. As consequence we were staying in cold 19,5 degree room over the night with small kid...

5. Heating floor in the bathroom doesn't work even though regulator for temperature is set for maximum. So be prepared for cold tile floor in the bathroom.

The good thing is that subway station is just 100 meters from hotel so easy access to the city center.

Beds are very comfortable to sleep, that is a big advantage that I have to admit !

There are also several boutiques and grocery shops just in case.

Unfortunately all those issues wouldn't make me to make decision of staying in that hotel once more even there are good things in this hotel.

Honestly do not recommend."

Negative part on the other hand...
The normal pizza (not gluten-free), was basically poorly made. That means the taste and look of it was not well.
The pizza maker obviously hates his job, or is not qualified for the job.

Then he tells its coming right up. Then he signals his chef to prepare it. I then ask if he forgot about it and he just laughs at me condescending. At this point, the only thing I have from the shop is him laughing at me for paying 60,- for his pizza, so I ask for my money back. Then he gets all worked up and starts yelling at me threatening - saying ""Det er min butik!"" Like some 6-year old. I have my 2-year-old on my arm, so I have no choice but to step outside and wait for them to make another pizza. Imagine what a simple apology for forgetting my order would have done...

When you get up on the second floor, you are also met by 2 large halls in a nice old-fashioned style.
Where it pulls down is respectively by the staff and by the sanitary conditions.
The staff could benefit from more experience, and more charisma. They do not seem to know the usual do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts when serving for a wedding. They also do not manage to coordinate the kitchen and toastmaster, so the wedding program can run optimally with speeches, etc.
Next, the sanitary conditions fall sharply on appearance. The style is something from a primary school from the 70s, and does not fit in at all with the beautiful style of the halls. The hygiene, however, failed nothing, thankfully."

It was Dec 14th 2019 early evening, so it would be expected that the kitchen would be in full force.  However, the food took a great amount of time to make it to the table,  the white wine (Vegan / Organic) as the server stated was dry and acidic! The chicken spring roll tasted like a potato roll deep-fried minus chicken! For a  bill of $ 450 Danish Kroner for a meal for two is a big rip off. The only good thing about the experience was that the server seated us quickly. I  had informed Anton whom was taking my payment about the experience and rather than try and offer some form of reduced price he was only concerned about $$
Moments like this i miss the U.S.,  for Americans understand service!
Lastly,  my stomach was sour for the rest of the night into the next day after consuming the meal. I love Thai Food and this was the worst Thai Food I have ever eaten,  avoid this place if you care about your stomach well being."

Noting it was an Italian (modern maybe?) restaurant and living in Italy we decided on the occasion of a family event with the relatives based in CPH to organize it here. We contacted more than a month in advance to book a table and discuss the menu noting that managing a group of 14 persons would not be easy for the kitchen. On our request to propose us options for seating, menu, drinks, etc. and possible choice for some with restricted dietary we received just a short and little courteous response - ""You will not be given choices on the day. It's a Saturday in July and as such we have very little flexibility."" This did not seem to be the style of communication anyone would expect from a property that positions itself the way they describe on their website. Unfortunately, do not know how good the food is and will not know. I guess we will be taking our business somewhere else where the staff has more courtesy in communicating with the clients.

I sat down on my chair which was covered in bread crumbs. We then proceeded to order drinks, be aware that not one person spoke danish, we ordered 2 normal draft beers, and 2 glasses of wine and  a soda. After a while we were informed that they had no more draft beer, only bottle beer, which they had only just put in the cooler ü§£.
We settled for a bottle of wine.
The starter was tasty and portions were reasonable.
We alle had stake for the main dish, we all ordered it medium rare, only one person was served a correct cooked stake, we had to send 4 out to be cooked from rare to medium rare. The stakes came back, cooked well and tasted very nice. Note they had 3 different sauces, we all ordered peber sauce, not one of us got the correct sauce. By the way sauce cost extra, we were not told.
They were supposed to serve one portion of oven baked potato, they were not oven baked, but did not cost extra üòã.
There is nothing good to say about desert, so i will leave it out.
We did order 2 cups of coffee for desert, it was so bad, i told them I simply would not pay for them.
At one point we ordered a coke, the coke came with the straw upside down in the glass, they simply did not have any pride in their work
Anyway, the whole experience was so awful all we could do was laugh at the experience and decide never to return."
10899,ChIJpz661BRTUkYR-8BGFtATLto,Jeppe M√∏lgaard,en,1,1634886552,"Terrible experience. Everything went wrong at this place. We waited 20 minutes to get seated despite having a reservation. Way to many people got crammed into a room that was too small. We got our food without our drinks and wasn't even asked what we wanted to drink. We had to ask  4 times (yes, I'm serious) before they got us supplementing water. We couldn't get in contact with any waiters. Half the clams in our moules frites was either empty or bad and the dish tasted bad in general. We got the wrong dessert - and the tiramisu was wet in the bottom. All tables around us (couldn't avoid talking to them because we were sitting so close) thought the whole experience was a joke... Don't go there."

Har aldrig ventet s√• l√¶nge p√• mad. Flere g√¶ster med senere ankomst end os fik deres mad f√∏r os -  muligvis en bevist nedprioritering af dem, der havde k√∏bt menuen som Deal? Dog var der tydeligt en generel utilfredshed i restauranten over ukoordineret og forsinket betjening, En br√∏dkurv og opfyldning af vand skete f√∏rst efter utallige opfordringer, og da vandet kom i f√∏rste omgang, var det uden glas, som tjeneren ville hente men glemte. Efter 20 min tid fik vi dem endelig ved at f√• fat p√• en anden tjener. Skaldyrsfadet, vi havde bestilt, kom uden nogen form for tilbeh√∏r. Senere opdagede vi, at der h√∏rte ayoli og br√∏d til, hvilket klart havde gjort det mere l√¶kkert.

Der var en hektisk og travl stemning, og betjeningen var helt sikkert elendig grundet alt for stort pres, tjenerne som s√•dan var s√∏de. Det er ikke i orden at drive en restaurant p√• den m√•de, hvor medarbejderne ikke kan n√• at betjene og glemmer stort set alt. Kan absolut ikke anbefale restauranten, b√•de pga. af den d√•rlige oplevelse som g√¶st, men ogs√• fordi et s√•dant sted efter min opfattelse ikke b√∏r st√∏ttes, f√∏r de skaber nogle bedre arbejdsforhold."

We chose one of each and it was extremely delicious. The dish itself was with too many crabs and there were only two giant prawns.
We could have liked more mixed on the dish.

They had forgotten to finish cooking the lobster so it was quite raw. But they fix it quickly.

Alioli was super and the waiter was sweet but forgot our wet napkins throughout the dinner .. but never mind

Good coffee ü•∞

Now for the more serious, the restaurant was dead cold and SCANDIC HOTELS WHO RENTALS FRONT WOULD NOT PUT OR SHUT UP THE HEAT BEFORE OCTOBER. As a landlord, you can not be so petty and greedy that you directly pee on your tenants so that their customers freeze and have to wear a jacket.

I'm shocked by SCANDIC AND THEIR HANDLING ... so the rooms themselves should not have heat on either ??
Who, however, will pay 1200-2500kr for a freezing chamber without heat.

I went to the reception but there was also no opportunity for a dialogue about the cold in the restaurant.

Thinking about 4 days when I come again they must have found a solution"

The restaurant benefits from a skylight several storeys above which means it feels light and airy. At the same time, it is decorated with lots of plants, with a tree in the middle of the dining room, giving it a cosy and fresh feel. We had a fantastic dinner there with some great friends after our wedding at Copenhagen City Hall and it was the perfect setting.

On top, the food is delicious and the waiting staff are top notch. The team clearly knew the menu from top to bottom and understood the ethos of the restaurant.

The menu, as we understood, changes on a regular basis with the most seasonal ingredients and this can be tasted in each dish. The dishes are innovatively designed and the cooking is done to a very high level. This is a place you don't want to miss on a visit to Copenhagen."

2. Price is not good and you can tell it because they will charge 10Dkk for a glass of tap water. It is so far the only restaurant will charge for tap water I've visited all over the world.
3. However, I have to say that the food is really good here. Almost authentic.
All in all, if you don't care about the quality of service or the price, this can be a good option for you if you wanna try some good Chinese food.

We sat in the window facing seats which was great for privacy but the chairs need better back support if you are to sit in them for three hours for the full serving. Asked to move to a table and the staff accommodated.

We happened to see this deli / market out of the corner of our eyes, and had no idea we were walking into a seriously high end French supermarket.  From fresh oysters to pate to a massive selection of French wine and supplies, this place is absolute heaven.

It's super expensive, but considering the location and the products, it's to be expected.  Plus, their champagne prices are fantastic for us Americans.  We purchased a couple bottles at about half what they cost back home; still more than what it would be at the duty free, but not by much.

They were happy to supply us with some coffee cups and we grabbed a few other small snacks.  Highly recommended, especially if you're walking around in the area (for the Mermaid, etc)."

It was a hit!
Our son and his friend had classic burgers and those went down, fast.
My wife also had a classic and being vegetarian i had the halloumi cheese burger.
Do not get me wrong, these were burgers the size of mountains.  Married with a good portion of fries (curlies, normal, sweet potatoes) one is set to tuck in into a feast for both eyes and palate.
I will definitely return."

Nice fries, but the aioli did not taste of aioli and the burger was horrible. Worst burger I‚Äôve had in a restarant.
The top brioche was cold and the slice of tomato was freezing, so when I bit into the burger it was a mix og warm and cold. The sauce had a weird bitter taste. The meat - first I thought it was a steak because it was so solid and compact, but I think it was minced beef. It was not flat so it didn‚Äôt fill the bun - making your first bite only bun with sauce. The meat was a semi-hard lump and very non-juicy.
I only had four bites of the burger and had a horrible taste in my mouth after."

Most, if not all, ingredients are sourced from Mexico and the cuisine is highly creative. They never compromise in flavor and service."

If you're new to Mexican food, try the torta. It's a sandwich, and yet so much more! If you're here on your lunch break and need a drink without alcohol, try the hibiscus tea. Yes, that sounds strange, but it is sweet, fruity, and refreshing. But please, also try the tacos. All the tacos."

The service is always super pushy and removes plates or empty glasses from the table or asks questions while you have a taco in your mouth. It‚Äôs so uncomfortable.

It was kind of like a concert of food, one amazing bite after the other, prepared right in front of you, note by note, reaching a perfect crescendo at the end. Everything was incredibly fresh, sourced in Denmark as much as possible, but from our close neighbor countries in some cases, and tuna from the Mediterranean. I wholeheartedly recommend this experience anyone with a love of Japanese sushi. There is only 8 seats, so it could be challenging to get a table."

The first time it was me and a couple of friends who arrived at 20.50 and were welcomed and shown to a table. Then three minutes passed and the same waiter came and told the chef had told them to close, closing time are 21.00!. Later, friends and I have tried to visit the place on two occasions.  Both times the staff told us they had ""problems"" in the kitchen and rejected us.  Last night I was alone and wanted to make one last attempt, the fourth, to put money into this restaurant. But had to leave when the staff told they to have two large companies so they could not welcome me. So for the fourth time I had to leave. This will be my last attempt to visit this place. Their lack of service and hospitality is not that tempting.  Especially when there are so many good restaurants that welcome their guests. I must finally add that I look completely normal and am both sober and polite. I am a tall Nordic man, so these repeated rejections make me wonder if I am exposed to pure racism.

Rich and flavourful dishes that combine an array of different ingredients, flavours and textures, resulting in a totally fresh and modern interpretation of traditional Filipino dishes. Thrilla in Manila is an absolute gem and a definite must try in Copenhagen.

The only critique I have is that the rice quality has varied quite a lot each time we‚Äôve ordered food here - at times perfectly cooked, but sometimes soggy, and other times dry and almost undercooked. I really hope the chefs look into this, as the food is truly amazing otherwise!"

There was an issue with a meal on one order, but this was quickly resolved by Carmelita, who was incredibly professional. I recommend you try their restaurant, there is something for everyone. I am looking forward to experiencing the restaurant in-person in the near future :)"

We went there for the buffet, which is you order every round and they bring it to your table.
At first you thought the staffs are pretty friendly chatting with you explaining how the buffet works and everything, then you start to order.
They have rules about food wasting which is you need to pay extra if you can‚Äôt finish at the end over a small amount of weight which I think it‚Äôs actually a good idea to stop food wasting, for this reason of course you can‚Äôt just order a bunch of food, what if you can‚Äôt finish it all? and they don‚Äôt have doggie bag service where you can just take the rest with you cuz it‚Äôs buffet.
4 of us ordered appropriate amount of food for each round, after probably 3 rounds, they started to show you an attitude which felt like they were questioning ‚Äúwhy you are still here eating?‚Äù with their looks!
It‚Äôs their rules and every consumer follows their rules, if they don‚Äôt want customers to do the buffet just simply don‚Äôt advertise they have buffet there! If they only want people to order once or twice then don‚Äôt say on the advertisement that you can eat all you want during this specific time!
The attitude is unacceptable!!!
What‚Äôs more was that 3 of us ordered tap water, they charge by individuals, At the end, one of my friends who didn‚Äôt order a drink took a sip from one of our glasses to rinse his mouth, he spit it out on a napkin and the napkin didn‚Äôt even get totally wet, I don‚Äôt know if this is legit business rule but they charged us extra tap water for that anyways! Wow!"

Jeg m√•tte r√•be adskillige gange da jeg havde et sp√∏rgsm√•l. Det var fuldst√¶ndig umuligt at h√∏re noget da musikken var meget meget h√∏j. Jeg r√•bte virkelig h√∏jt.

I was a bit hesitant after seeing the poor reviews here, but I'm glad we ignored them and went anyway!  I hope more people give it a try.

We were two adults and a ten-year-old who has outgrown kids' menus, but there was much to choose from and satisfy all our different palates at a reasonable price.  The bread and garlic ramp butter for the table was dangerously tempting in the way restaurant breads should be.  We shared a delicious (and enormous) fried calamari appetizer to start, and then enjoyed a warm goat cheese main-dish salad, an order of fish and chips, and a burger.  None of the three was extraordinary, but all were tasty and satisfying.  Our white and ros√© wines by the glass were nice as well.

We were served promptly and graciously, did not wait long at all for our food and drink to arrive, and didn't have any of the problems that other reviewers mentioned.

The restaurant has a lovely modern, high-ceiling decor. Outdoor courtyard seating is available as well, with a large awning in case of rain, and blankets for the chill.

In sum, it's excellent place for families looking for something nicer than fast food, but without breaking the bank, and with a variety of options for different appetites."
11408,ChIJZVq9UQZTUkYRWwemxeFXb5Y,Niels Christian S√∏rensen,en,2,1632332992,"The 2 stars are given with the following facts in mind:

- We ordered a pariserb√∏f and asked for the meat to be served medium rare - twice when the waitress returned to ask if I wanted raw onions. The munched meat served was of really bad quality and of cause extreme well done. I suspect that it was pre roasted and simply warmed up. One star for that

- The other dish was a ‚Äúfresh r√∏dsp√¶tte‚Äù with hand peeled fjord shrimps.
A deep fried frozen breaded fish was served with defrosted shrimps. The ‚Äúplease serve the mayonnaise aside‚Äù was not passed to the kitchen. For the cost, one star would be appropriate here.

- The grandson had a pasta with meat sauce. Not interesting at all and for the price definitely not value for money. Let‚Äôs give it 3 stars to be fair.

So an average of 2 is a max from us.

- last
- only time

- Hygiene and Taste: The restaurant has been receiving very big smiles (expectedly üòé) when it comes to keeping the place as clean as they keep their foods tasty üíØüòç

- Price: Very decent prices for a pizza place - completely worth it, and also it's all affordable as you can see them on their menu.

- Location: Convenient placement - placed in Amager where it takes around 5-10 mins walk from Amagerbro Metro Station.

- Seating: It is possible to sit down while waiting for your order to be ready since there are around 4 chairs available in total both inside and outside. However, it will be a really good idea to take your food with you due to not having sufficient space for seating inside.

Overall, the place is owned by two very gentle and sincere men who thrive in giving the best quality pizzas, sandwiches and pastas to their customers.

The lady who was there at the time was really nice and we chatted a little after I bought ingredients. This was how I came to discover Chiang Mai, the lady's son works in this restaurant (I think she told me he owned it, but my memory is a little blurry) and she was very proudly talking about it and him. Today, with the weather being gloomy and I was feeling unwell, my partner and I went to order takeout from here and we were not disappointed. I usually love my curry strong and with a lot of kick but the mild red curry was a welcome change. Boyfriend ordered sweet and sour duck. Nice that you can choose which meat goes with your dish. We also loved how much veggies they added in, and didn't just cover up the quantity with sauce like a lot of restaurants do. Decent main dish to rice ratio, wish I'd ordered more rice to go with my curry! Will be back to order again."

This place is for take away only which means they have to one up their food and taste as that is their selling point unlike other places.

Their chili paste wok is also great and only just enough spicy so you can still eat it and taste everything else.

Overall great and very fast made (10-15 min). I've ordered food a lot of times from this place and the quality is consistent which is an important selling point for me too. (i.e. You know what to expect every time.)

Maybe it was bad luck, but somehow it seemed as they had a used lower quality ingredients and spent less time on making sure it‚Äôs a good dish. Maybe the location has become too popular that there is no need to make sure the food is good any more. Somebody feed Phil? I do not think so‚Ä¶"

The order was supposed to arrive at 8 am to deliver the breakfast. At 9 am I contacted Meyers and was told they made a mistake and had our order scheduled for the following day (even though I had followed up with them the day before and the order was completed over email where the date of the delivery was confirmed in writing). Our event officially started at 9 and we had promised our guests a full breakfast. One hour later (2 hours after the scheduled delivery time), Meyers delivered ""complementary"" spandauer and cinnamon swirls along with juice. By this time we were already forced to purchase goods from another a bakery nearby to hold over our guests. If you are hosting an important event, please consider another cater. While mistakes happen, the way it was handled was completely unprofessional as Meyers offered no compensation for their error."

I also got a notification to say I could call your number to cancel the order or for any other reason but no one is picking up and the phone line isn't engaged.

I feel very disheartened and don't know why you got high ratings overall. The order was placed around 18:20 this evening, with no email confirmation and no updates on when I can expect my food. It said on the app that the average time would be 41 minutes. It's now 19:19.

If I knew it would take longer, with no courtesy updates, and no way to speak to someone (which feels like you're avoiding picking up the phone really), my only confirmation is through my mobile pay app that you took my money and I still see no sign of food or updates to track my order.

I would really appreciate some form of contact and that I shouldn't wait so long for food, because I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, and trust you to make that order, because your business seemed trustworthy enough.

But it doesn't seem to be with no way to contact any of you. I've been on the phone a while now waiting, and you have this stupid annoying music playing so people will want to give up calling you.

So why only 4.5 and not 5 stars?  I reserve that for pizza that is worth traveling out of your way for, which is usually a combination of good pizza and a super cozy atmosphere.

12262,ChIJp8YSwV6rU0YRWlxzJ1f1vIE,Martin Larsen,en-US,3,1630613224,"We came with high expectations for Wok Flame Thai because we missed a good Thai eatery nearby. But unfortunately, our expectations were not fully met.

We had to wait a long time for the food, but ok, it's a small kitchen and we had hit a busy time. But for example the shrimp chips they could have brought with them immediately. We only got them when after half an hour we asked for them.

There was a strong, sharp stegeos from the kitchen due to poor ventilation. We coughed and I had to go out a few times to breathe. The engine on the hood was obviously broken, so hopefully they will solve the problem soon.

Unfortunately, the Panaeng curry was way too strong, almost inedible. Usually, panaeng is not a particularly strong dish, nor was it marked with a chili on the menu. The chef said that no chili had been added at all, and that may be true, but then it is because they use a very strong panaeng curry paste which adds too much strength to the dish from scratch.

It should be noted that we are used to Thai food here in the house and often make it ourselves. Has attended cooking school in Chiang Mai and on a course at home, and grows his own coffee lime, coriander and Thai basil. So we are not novices.

The problem apparently also applies to other of the dishes, at least we overheard a conversation from another table where a guest also noticed that the dish was strong, on the verge of the inedible.

Either way, if the dish is so strong, then it needs to be labeled correctly. By comparison, the Tom Yum soup was labeled with a single chili, and it was quite mild, actually milder than usual, and much much milder than the panaeng curry which did not have a chili at all! Incidentally, the soup was good.

On the plus side is that the staff was very friendly. First, they offered a new time panaeng, hopefully milder. It was not, but it is probably due to the fact that it is the base paste itself that is too strong. Since it was not a success either, the waiter then offered a completely different dish where the choice fell on pad thai which fortunately was not strong (it is pad thai never).

The reasonable prices must also be emphasized.

We would love to come again and hope for a better experience next time."

For starters, the owner, Marta, will make you feel like royalty from the moment you set foot in the door, to the moment you leave. She is so attentive, genuine, caring and sweet that it might make you melt. I have been to many restaurants, and I have honestly never come across a host, who is so emotionally and actively invested in creating the most beautiful experience for their guests. She treats every person at the table, not only with the highest respect, but with genuine attention to make you feel special.

The pizzas are absolutely delicious, with freshly sourced ingredients (from the most superior supermarket in Denmark) and with organic meat. The dough of the pizza was perfect; fluffy with a delicate crunch. The flavours are amazing, and with the most unique combinations of toppings I have come across, definitely like no other pizza joint you have ever been to.

The design of the restaurant was so carefully thought out, tall plants and flowers blossoming around you, spacious room but with a cozy vibe. Huge windows looking out to the beautiful Amager Strand, only a few minutes away from having your feet in the ocean. Gorgeous wallpaper around the restaurant and in the bathroom... oh the bathroom. That is an experience in itself. Unique furniture, wallpaper, soap and lotion, that once again, make it feel a bit like a royal experience.

My warmest recommendation to this delicious and wonderful restaurant, and a salute to Marta, the kindest and most invested owner I have ever met."

But, these are beyond. We forgot to take pictures of them because they were super delicious. :)
Not only fresh and delightful, but also pizzas have their rhythm and introduction to the world of Tasty. If somebody asks me where to go in Copenhagen, I will recommend this place for pizzas first.
We felt very pleasant for the kind service. The owner warmly welcomed us in a spacious and crispy clean restaurant with a smile. The place was cozy, comfy, and bright. If you sit near the window, you can see all the green and beach areas."

Gorm‚Äòs artisanal pasta & pizza can be found in what might only be described as the ‚ÄòMagnificent Mile‚Äô of Copenhagen Airport‚Äôs 3rd Terminal. This restaurant stands out in a sea of bustling and vibrant storefronts & eateries, which is all the more impressive given that the CPH has many things, but a paucity of food & beverage options is not among them.

Items of note:

First and foremost, all of the staff members came across as genuinely cheerful, rather than the occasional forced friendliness you encounter at some establishments.

Secondly, there are only a handful of pastas to select from, but the menu options that made the cut have been expertly refined for optimal taste and economic value. I opted to try the Al Rag≈õ pasta dish, which is essentially a light bolognese sauce topped with fresh spinach and grated parmesan cheese. It was thoroughly satisfying and I would gladly order it again üëåüèº.

We had booked Kastrup Fortet for a party, and had for over a month been in dialogue with them about details for the party, choice of menu, wines, time, table setting, etc. We had invited guests and booked the DJ.
One late evening we get an email that they have double booked the date and chosen to go with the other company - completely out of the blue and the email is without empathy for the situation we are now in.

After we have started to share our experience with guests etc., we are told that this is not the first time they hear about double booking of Kastrup Fort.

We are left with the feeling that there has been a bigger or better event that they have chosen to go with. For how else can one not avoid seeing that there is double booking for more than a month? Especially because we talked about that there was another event earlier the same day that it was to be matched with.

We do not hope that there are others who will be in the same situation as us, and will therefore strongly encourage you not to book the place!"

Here in Denmark its much better balanced.
If i have to complain, the coffee is awesome BUT with an obvious Robusta note, i think they could have adjusted the strength with a pure Arabica coffee to make the same experience, just better with the pure Arabica flavor.
The worst is the garlic dressing, big plus for being made completely in-house, this is without doubt fresh and made with the very superior Scandinavian fresh sour cream (R√∏mme), this one would have been a dream come true if not for one thing ruining it: Too much garlic. Thats a beginners mistake, i chose to believe a new employee screwed up. Im not a garlic lover but even garlic lovers would be surprised of the amount of garlic in this one, i swear its true that I actually jumped in the chair on the first taste, i was so unprepared for it.

Cars constantly cut in line, all the time, because the drive thru can't handle the influx of customers it has.
Easily the worst McDonald's in Copenhagen."
12514,ChIJB7qXe3mrU0YR0KqTfvvJwBk,Brian Welch,en,3,1630147441,They had no gluten free buns. The place was absolutely disgusting. The food is what you expect from McDonalds. They do have wifi and free refills.
12515,ChIJB7qXe3mrU0YR0KqTfvvJwBk,marione Dunford,en,4,1632049695,"Great service, the one thing it doesn't have is the touch screen order service, this is near Copenhagen Airport about a ten minute walk on foot"
12516,ChIJB7qXe3mrU0YR0KqTfvvJwBk,Andy Denness,en,4,1599344489,"Ended up going because BK was closed in the airport and we had 8hours to kill, Was your standard maccies, the cheese and chilli bites were really good, the double big T with bacon was good, the place seemed clean but the hand soap had ran out in the bathroom. also they had a different menu to what I'm used to in the UK but I think I liked it more, prices were higher than my local one in the UK maybe close to London prices not too sure, would go again."
12517,ChIJB7qXe3mrU0YR0KqTfvvJwBk,Kaare Axelsen,en,1,1633354540,Only come here if you have PLENTY of time.  Lots of staff but only they and God knows what they are doing ‚Ä¶. Food and drinks are usual quality for McD
12518,ChIJYULbnn2rU0YRhs6TCckvdNE,Annemette Geertinger,en,4,1633168162,Nice place with good food and fine service
12519,ChIJYULbnn2rU0YRhs6TCckvdNE,Jes Hunsballe,en,3,1628581939,"Nice dishes in general but somewhat poor brunch (seemed like a bake-off bun, cold sausages), all too pricey for what you get."
12520,ChIJYULbnn2rU0YRhs6TCckvdNE,Paulina Krzyskow,en,2,1595969348,"I have a one year old child, and was happy to see high chairs.. But never in my life I have seen that dirty high chairs.. And there was not many people at the restaurant at that time.. Weiters were standing and doing nothing. It was really disgusting and disappointing to see this old dirt and food.. Tables also not cleaned properly.. Ours smelled so bad because of dirt under it. Please do better job with cleaning.
Food was tasty. But portions are really funny - Big box with fried sea food looks like for 5 year old. On the other hand there are too many vegetables served, and I say it as a vegetable lover. I also bought some deal main+side+dip+drink, but at the end I couldn't get the drink that I wanted although it was on the drink list."
12521,ChIJYULbnn2rU0YRhs6TCckvdNE,Erasmus Holm,en,2,1627209204,Super slow and undedicated service. Average food. Avoid
12522,ChIJYULbnn2rU0YRhs6TCckvdNE,Martin Jul J√∂nsson,en,3,1573506719,"First things first, the burger and fries was actually good and the place has got a super lovely view over the ocean. No doubt about that! :-)

When that is said, the prices are just to high for what it really is. Yes yes, this is the only place to eat in the aquarium and people will probably still go here even if the prices were even higher.

But if I had to compare the burger to the high price.... well, then it's nowhere near what you can get other places in Copenhagen and I would save my money."
12523,ChIJt_Xy1jerU0YRUnyzste3n4c,Nicolai Kragh-Hansen,en,5,1626191449,Great burgers! Make sure to get your orders in early cos they're popular.

Man kan smage at b√∏fferne er frisklavet og at k√∏det er af en god kvalitet.
Tak for mad!"

12527,ChIJt_Xy1jerU0YRUnyzste3n4c,Mikkel Diamant Madsen,en-US,4,1618898210,"Would like to recommend the place. Very good burgers and fries. We have ordered several times in the company, but all orders have been faulty. There must be significant optimization from order receipt to execution."
